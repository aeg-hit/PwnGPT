Based on the information you've provided, let's analyze the binary executable `int1` to assess its security features and potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited in a Capture the Flag (CTF) challenge.

### **1. File Information**

```
./pwn/integer/int-1/int1: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux.so.2, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, BuildID[sha1]=..., not stripped
```

- **Architecture**: **32-bit** executable for **Intel x86 (i386)** architecture.
- **Endianness**: Little-Endian (`LSB` stands for Least Significant Byte first).
- **Dynamically Linked**: The binary is dynamically linked, meaning it relies on external libraries at runtime.
- **Interpreter**: Uses `/lib/ld-linux.so.2` as the dynamic linker/loader.
- **Build ID**: Contains a BuildID, which can help in debugging and symbol resolution.
- **Not Stripped**: **Symbols are present**, making reverse engineering and analysis easier because function names and other symbols are included.

### **2. Security Properties (Checksec Output)**

```
{
  "./pwn/integer/int-1/int1": {
    "relro": "partial",
    "canary": "no",
    "nx": "yes",
    "pie": "no",
    "rpath": "no",
    "runpath": "no",
    "symbols": "yes",
    "fortify_source": "no",
    "fortified": "0",
    "fortify-able": "4"
  }
}
```

Let's break down each security feature and its implications:

#### **a. RELRO (Relocation Read-Only): Partial**

- **Description**: Partial RELRO sets certain sections of the binary as read-only after initialization but leaves the **Global Offset Table (GOT)** writable.
- **Implication**: Attackers can overwrite GOT entries at runtime, enabling **GOT overwrite attacks** to hijack function pointers.

#### **b. Stack Canary: No**

- **Description**: Stack canaries are special values placed on the stack to detect buffer overflows before overwriting return addresses.
- **Implication**: Absence of stack canaries means the binary is vulnerable to **stack-based buffer overflow attacks**, allowing overwriting of the return address without detection.

#### **c. NX (No eXecute): Yes**

- **Description**: The stack is marked as non-executable, preventing execution of code injected into the stack (e.g., shellcode).
- **Implication**: Attackers cannot execute code directly on the stack. Instead, they must use techniques like **Return-Oriented Programming (ROP)** or **Return-to-libc** to execute existing code in memory.

#### **d. PIE (Position Independent Executable): No**

- **Description**: The binary is not compiled as PIE, so it has a fixed base address when loaded into memory.
- **Implication**: Address spaces (e.g., code segment addresses) are predictable, simplifying the exploitation process because addresses of functions and gadgets are consistent across executions.

#### **e. RPATH & RUNPATH: No**

- **Description**: No runtime library search paths are specified.
- **Implication**: There are no additional library search paths that could introduce vulnerabilities or be manipulated.

#### **f. Symbols: Yes**

- **Description**: Symbol information is present in the binary.
- **Implication**: Easier to reverse engineer and identify function names, which aids in understanding the binary's functionality and crafting an exploit.

#### **g. Fortify Source: No**

- **Description**: The binary was not compiled with `_FORTIFY_SOURCE`, a compile-time macro that adds checks to detect certain buffer overflows.
- **Implication**: Functions vulnerable to overflows (like `strcpy`, `sprintf`, etc.) are not fortified, increasing the risk of exploitation.

#### **h. Fortified Functions: 0 out of 4**

- **Description**: None of the 4 functions that could be fortified are protected.
- **Implication**: Potential unsafe functions are unprotected, offering more opportunities for exploitation.

### **3. Potential Exploitation Strategies**

Based on the analysis above, several vulnerabilities could be exploited:

#### **A. Stack-Based Buffer Overflow**

- **Opportunity**: Lack of stack canaries allows overwriting the **saved return address** on the stack.
- **Challenge**: **NX** is enabled, so injected shellcode on the stack cannot be executed directly.

#### **B. Return-to-libc Attack**

- **Technique**: Overwrite the return address to point to standard library functions like `system()`, `execve()`, etc.
- **Advantage**:
  - **Non-PIE Binary**: Fixed addresses simplify locating functions.
  - **Symbols Present**: Easier to find function addresses.
- **Steps**:
  1. Find the address of `system()` or another suitable function.
  2. Overwrite the return address to jump to `system("/bin/sh")` or similar.

#### **C. Return-Oriented Programming (ROP)**

- **Technique**: Chain together small snippets of existing code (**gadgets**) ending with `ret` to perform arbitrary operations.
- **Advantage**:
  - **Non-PIE Binary**: Gadgets are at known addresses.
  - **Symbols Present**: Easier to locate gadgets and functions.
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify necessary gadgets (e.g., for setting up registers).
  2. Build a ROP chain to call desired functions with controlled arguments.

#### **D. GOT Overwrite Attack**

- **Opportunity**: Partial RELRO means the **GOT is writable**.
- **Technique**: Overwrite a GOT entry of a frequently called function (e.g., `puts()`) to point to malicious code or another function like `system()`.
- **Steps**:
  1. Overwrite the GOT entry of a function used in the program.
  2. When the program calls that function, control flow is redirected.

### **4. Recommendations for Exploitation**

Given the binary's security properties:

- **Start by Analyzing Input Handling**:
  - Look for functions like `gets()`, `strcpy()`, `sprintf()`, or any custom input functions that do not enforce bounds checking.
  - These functions are often entry points for buffer overflows.

- **Leverage Fixed Memory Addresses**:
  - Since ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) mitigation is not indicated, and PIE is disabled, memory addresses for code segments are predictable.
  - Use tools like `objdump`, `nm`, or `readelf` to find addresses of functions and gadgets.

- **Prepare for NX Mitigation**:
  - Plan to avoid executing code on the stack.
  - Focus on reusing existing executable code segments in memory.

- **Check for Available Functions**:
  - Identify if functions like `system()`, `execve()`, or `mprotect()` are available for use in your exploit.
  - If they are not directly available, consider leveraging `dlsym()` or similar functions if possible.

- **Use the Presence of Symbols**:
  - Take advantage of the symbol information to understand the program's flow and find useful functions and gadgets.

### **5. Conclusion**

The binary `int1` presents several classic vulnerabilities that can be exploited using standard techniques in binary exploitation:

- **Buffer Overflows**: Due to the absence of stack canaries and fortification.
- **Control Flow Hijacking**: By overwriting the return address or function pointers.
- **Bypassing NX**: Through ROP or return-to-libc attacks.

**Key Strategies**:

- **Return-to-libc Attacks**: Utilize known function addresses to execute code.
- **ROP Chains**: Build chains to perform complex operations without injecting code.
- **GOT Overwrite**: Manipulate GOT entries to redirect function calls.

**Note**: Always ensure that any exploitation attempts are conducted in a controlled environment and are compliant with the rules of the CTF competition.

### **Next Steps**

- **Dynamic Analysis**: Run the binary under a debugger (e.g., GDB) to observe how it handles input and to confirm vulnerabilities.
- **Exploit Development**: Craft input payloads to exploit identified vulnerabilities.
- **Testing**: Test your exploits thoroughly to ensure reliability.

By understanding the security properties and potential vulnerabilities of `int1`, you can develop a targeted approach to the challenge and apply appropriate exploitation techniques.
