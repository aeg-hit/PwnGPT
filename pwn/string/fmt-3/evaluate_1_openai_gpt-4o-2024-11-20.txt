Based on the provided information, here is the analysis of the binary:

### 1. **File Information**
- The binary is a **64-bit ELF executable** for the x86-64 architecture.
- It is **dynamically linked**, meaning it relies on shared libraries at runtime.
- The binary is **stripped**, which means symbol information (like function names) has been removed, making reverse engineering slightly more challenging.
- The interpreter is `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`, which is the standard dynamic linker for 64-bit Linux systems.

### 2. **Security Properties (Checksec Output)**
- **RELRO: Full**
  - Full RELRO (Relocation Read-Only) is enabled, which protects the GOT (Global Offset Table) from being overwritten. This mitigates certain types of GOT overwrite attacks.
- **Canary: No**
  - Stack canaries are not enabled. This means the binary is vulnerable to stack-based buffer overflow attacks, as there is no protection against overwriting the return address on the stack.
- **NX: Yes**
  - The NX (No-eXecute) bit is enabled, which means the stack and other writable sections of memory are non-executable. This prevents direct execution of shellcode injected into these regions.
- **PIE: No**
  - Position Independent Executable (PIE) is not enabled. This means the binary is loaded at a fixed address in memory, making it easier to predict the location of functions and other code. This simplifies exploitation, as you don't need to bypass ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) for the binary itself.
- **RPATH/RUNPATH: No**
  - No custom RPATH or RUNPATH is set, so the binary uses the default library search paths.
- **Symbols: No**
  - The binary is stripped, so symbol information is not available. This makes debugging and reverse engineering more difficult.
- **Fortify Source: No**
  - The binary is not compiled with `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE`, which means it lacks additional protections against certain buffer overflows in standard library functions.
- **Fortified Functions: 0/5**
  - None of the 5 fortifiable functions in the binary are fortified. This indicates a lack of additional protections for these functions.

### 3. **Potential Exploitation Vectors**
Given the above properties, here are some potential exploitation vectors:
- **Format String Vulnerability**: Since the challenge is named `fmt3`, it is likely related to a format string vulnerability. Format string vulnerabilities occur when user-controlled input is passed to a function like `printf` without proper sanitization. This can allow an attacker to:
  - Leak memory addresses (e.g., using `%p` or `%x`).
  - Overwrite memory (e.g., using `%n`).
- **No Stack Canary**: The absence of stack canaries makes the binary vulnerable to stack-based buffer overflows.
- **No PIE**: The lack of PIE means the binary is loaded at a fixed address, making it easier to locate functions and other code in memory.
- **NX Enabled**: Since NX is enabled, direct execution of shellcode on the stack or other writable regions is not possible. However, Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) or other techniques can be used to bypass this protection.

### 4. **Exploitation Strategy**
- **Step 1: Analyze the Binary**
  - Use tools like `strings`, `objdump`, or `Ghidra` to analyze the binary and identify the vulnerable function(s).
  - Look for format string vulnerabilities, especially in functions like `printf`, `fprintf`, or `snprintf` where user input might be passed directly.
- **Step 2: Leak Information**
  - Use the format string vulnerability to leak memory addresses (e.g., stack addresses, GOT entries, or libc addresses).
  - This can help bypass ASLR for shared libraries like libc.
- **Step 3: Overwrite Memory**
  - Use the format string vulnerability to overwrite critical memory locations, such as GOT entries or return addresses.
  - Since there is no PIE, you can directly calculate the addresses of functions or variables in the binary.
- **Step 4: Craft Exploit**
  - Depending on the goal of the challenge, you might need to execute a shell, read a flag, or perform some other action.
  - Use the leaked information and memory overwrites to achieve the desired outcome.

### 5. **Tools to Use**
- **Static Analysis**: `strings`, `objdump`, `Ghidra`, `IDA Pro`.
- **Dynamic Analysis**: `gdb`, `pwndbg`, `gef`, `libc-database` (to identify libc version if needed).
- **Exploit Development**: `pwntools` (Python library for exploit development).

### 6. **Conclusion**
This binary appears to be vulnerable to a format string attack, given the challenge name and the lack of certain protections. The absence of stack canaries and PIE makes exploitation easier. However, NX is enabled, so you will need to use techniques like ROP or GOT overwrites to execute arbitrary code or achieve the challenge's goal.
