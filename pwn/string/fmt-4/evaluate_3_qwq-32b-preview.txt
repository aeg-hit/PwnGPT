To solve this CTF challenge using Pwntools, you'll need to exploit a format string vulnerability in the given binary. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you through the process:

### Step 1: Understand the Binary

The binary is a 32-bit ELF executable with the following properties:

- **Partial Relro**: Some protections are in place, but not full RELRO.
- **No Canary**: No stack canaries are used.
- **NX enabled**: Non-executable stack is enabled.
- **No PIE**: Position Independent Executable is not enabled.

The main function does the following:

1. Reads a pointer to a backdoor function and prints it as "gift".
2. Enters a loop where it reads input from stdin and prints it using `printf`.

### Step 2: Identify the Vulnerability

The vulnerability lies in the way the input is handled:

- The binary reads input into a buffer of size 255 bytes.
- This buffer is then passed directly to `printf`, which interprets it as a format string.

This is a classic format string vulnerability, where an attacker can control the format specifiers and potentially leak information or perform other attacks.

### Step 3: Exploit the Format String Vulnerability

Our goal is to exploit the format string vulnerability to leak the address of the backdoor function and then call it to spawn a shell.

#### Steps to Exploit:

1. **Leak the Address of the Backdoor Function**:
   - The backdoor function address is printed as "gift: <address>".
   - We can read this address and use it in our exploit.

2. **Overflow the Buffer and Control the Stack**:
   - Since the binary is vulnerable to format string attacks, we can use format specifiers to write data to specific addresses.

3. **Call the Backdoor Function**:
   - By controlling the stack or certain registers, we can call the backdoor function to spawn a shell.

### Step 4: Craft the Exploit Using Pwntools

Pwntools is a powerful Python framework for exploit development. We'll use it to automate the exploit.

#### Code Explanation:

1. **Connect to the Binary**:
   - Use `process` to spawn the binary locally or `remote` to connect to a remote server.

2. **Read the Gift Address**:
   - Read the line containing the backdoor address and parse it.

3. **Craft the Payload**:
   - Use format string specifiers to overwrite a function pointer or modify the stack to call the backdoor function.

4. **Send the Payload**:
   - Send the crafted payload to the binary.

5. **Interact with the Shell**:
   - If successful, interact with the spawned shell.

#### Sample Code:

```python
from pwn import *

# Start the binary locally
p = process('./fmt')

# Read the gift address
p.recvuntil('gift: ')
gift_addr = p.recvline().strip()
gift_addr = int(gift_addr, 16)
log.info(f'Gift address: {hex(gift_addr)}')

# Craft the payload
# We need to overwrite a function pointer or modify the stack to call the backdoor
# For simplicity, assume we can overwrite the return address on the stack

# Calculate the offset to the return address
offset = 256  # Assuming the buffer is 256 bytes

# Create the payload
payload = b'A' * offset  # Padding to reach the return address
payload += p32(gift_addr)  # Overwrite the return address with the backdoor address

# Send the payload
p.sendline(payload)

# Interact with the shell
p.interactive()
```

### Step 5: Run the Exploit

Execute the Python script to run the exploit:

```sh
python exploit.py
```

### Notes:

- **Address Calculation**: Ensure that the address of the backdoor function is correctly parsed and used.
- **Buffer Size**: Adjust the offset if the buffer size is different.
- **Stack Layout**: Understand the stack layout to correctly overwrite the return address or other critical data.

This should give you a basic framework to exploit the format string vulnerability and achieve code execution to spawn a shell. Adjustments may be needed based on the specific binary and environment.
