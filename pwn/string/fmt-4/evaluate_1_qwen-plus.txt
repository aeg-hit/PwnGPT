### Analysis

#### Architecture and Linking
- **32-bit**: This means the binary is compiled for a 32-bit architecture, which can be easier to exploit compared to 64-bit binaries due to smaller address spaces.
- **Dynamically Linked**: The binary uses shared libraries, which can be useful for certain types of attacks like Return-Oriented Programming (ROP).

#### Security Features
- **Partial RELRO**: Partial RELRO (Relocation Read-Only) means that some relocations are protected, but not all. This provides some level of protection against certain types of attacks but is not as strong as full RELRO.
- **No Stack Canaries**: The absence of stack canaries makes the binary more vulnerable to stack-based buffer overflow attacks.
- **NX (Non-Executable Stack)**: The stack is marked as non-executable, which prevents direct code execution from the stack. However, this can be bypassed using techniques like Return-to-libc or ROP.
- **No PIE (Position Independent Executable)**: The binary is not position-independent, meaning its base address is fixed. This makes it easier to predict addresses, which is useful for exploitation.
- **No RPATH or RUNPATH**: These settings are not set, which is generally a good thing as they can sometimes be abused.
- **Symbols Present**: The presence of symbols can help in reverse engineering and understanding the binary's structure.
- **No Fortify Source**: The binary was not compiled with fortify source, which means it may be vulnerable to certain types of buffer overflow attacks.

### Potential Attack Vectors
Given the security properties, several potential attack vectors can be considered:

1. **Format String Vulnerability**: The name `fmt4` suggests that the binary might have a format string vulnerability. If the binary allows user input to be used as a format string, you can use this to read or write arbitrary memory locations.
2. **Stack Buffer Overflow**: Without stack canaries, a stack buffer overflow can be exploited to overwrite the return address and control the execution flow.
3. **Return-to-libc**: Since the stack is non-executable, you can use a return-to-libc attack to call functions like `system()` to execute commands.
4. **ROP (Return-Oriented Programming)**: If there are no useful gadgets in the binary itself, you can use gadgets from dynamically linked libraries to construct your payload.
5. **Information Leaks**: Use format string vulnerabilities or other techniques to leak addresses, which can help in bypassing ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization).

### Next Steps
1. **Reverse Engineer the Binary**: Use tools like `gdb`, `IDA Pro`, or `Ghidra` to understand the binary's functionality and identify potential vulnerabilities.
2. **Test for Format String Vulnerability**: Provide controlled input to see if the binary behaves unexpectedly.
3. **Identify Buffer Overflows**: Look for functions that handle user input and check if they are susceptible to buffer overflows.
4. **Construct Exploits**: Based on the identified vulnerabilities, craft payloads to exploit the binary.

By following these steps, you should be able to develop a strategy to solve the challenge. Good luck!
