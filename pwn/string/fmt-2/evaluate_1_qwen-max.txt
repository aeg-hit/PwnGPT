Sure, let's break down the information provided and analyze it in the context of a binary exploitation (pwn) challenge.

### File Information
- **File Type**: `ELF 64-bit LSB executable, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV)`
  - This indicates that the binary is a 64-bit Linux executable.
- **Dynamically Linked**: The binary is dynamically linked, which means it uses shared libraries at runtime.
- **Interpreter**: `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2`
  - This is the dynamic linker/loader used to load and link the shared libraries.
- **BuildID**: `81593855a5562e175ec76c6d4f3a88cf2e85ebbb`
  - A unique identifier for the build, useful for debugging and tracking.
- **Not Stripped**: The binary contains symbols, which can be very helpful for reverse engineering and understanding the code.

### Security Properties
- **RELRO (Relocation Read-Only)**: `partial`
  - Partial RELRO means that the GOT (Global Offset Table) is only partially protected. The GOT is writable, but the PLT (Procedure Linkage Table) is read-only. This makes the binary more vulnerable to certain types of attacks, such as GOT overwrites.
- **Canary**: `yes`
  - Stack canaries are present, which helps protect against stack-based buffer overflows by detecting changes to the canary value.
- **NX (No eXecute)**: `yes`
  - The NX bit is enabled, which prevents execution of code on the stack, heap, or data segments. This mitigates some types of exploits, such as return-to-libc and ROP (Return-Oriented Programming).
- **PIE (Position Independent Executable)**: `no`
  - The binary is not compiled with PIE, meaning it has a fixed base address in memory. This can make it easier to predict addresses, which is useful for certain types of exploits.
- **RPATH and RUNPATH**: `no`
  - These are not set, which means the binary does not specify a custom search path for shared libraries.
- **Symbols**: `yes`
  - The binary contains symbols, which can be very helpful for reverse engineering and understanding the code.
- **Fortify Source**: `no`
  - Fortify source is not enabled, which means functions like `strcpy` and `sprintf` are not replaced with safer versions (`strncpy`, `snprintf`), making the binary more vulnerable to format string and buffer overflow attacks.
- **Fortified and Fortify-able Functions**: `0 fortified, 1 fortify-able`
  - There are no fortified functions, and there is one function that could have been fortified.

### Analysis
1. **Format String Vulnerability**:
   - Given the name of the challenge (`fmt-2`) and the fact that `fortify_source` is not enabled, it is likely that this binary is vulnerable to a format string attack. Format string vulnerabilities occur when a program uses user input as a format string argument for functions like `printf` without proper validation.
   - Since the binary is not stripped, you can use tools like `gdb` to find the vulnerable function and the offset to the return address or other important values.

2. **Exploitation Strategy**:
   - **Identify the Vulnerable Function**: Use `gdb` to set breakpoints and inspect the flow of the program to find where the format string vulnerability is.
   - **Find the Offset**: Use a pattern to determine the offset to the return address or other important values.
   - **Leak Addresses**: If the binary is not compiled with PIE, you can leak the addresses of libc functions or other important values to calculate the base address of the libc.
   - **Overwrite Values**: Use the format string vulnerability to overwrite the return address or other important values to gain control of the execution flow.
   - **Execute Payload**: Craft a payload to execute your desired code, such as spawning a shell.

### Tools and Techniques
- **GDB**: For debugging and inspecting the binary.
- **Pwntools**: A powerful CTF framework for writing exploit scripts.
- **ROPgadget**: To find gadgets for ROP chains if needed.
- **One-Gadget**: To find one-gadget RCEs in libc if available.

By following these steps and using the appropriate tools, you should be able to exploit the format string vulnerability in the binary.
