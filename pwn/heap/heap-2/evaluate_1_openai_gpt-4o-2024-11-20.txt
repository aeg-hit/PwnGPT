Based on the provided information, here is the analysis of the binary:

### File Information:
- **ELF 64-bit LSB executable**: The binary is a 64-bit ELF file, which is the standard format for executables on Linux systems.
- **x86-64 architecture**: The binary is compiled for the x86-64 architecture.
- **Dynamically linked**: The binary relies on shared libraries at runtime, which means it uses external libraries for some of its functionality.
- **Interpreter**: The binary uses `/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2` as its dynamic linker/loader.
- **Not stripped**: The binary is not stripped, meaning it still contains symbol information (e.g., function names, variable names). This is helpful for reverse engineering and debugging.

### Security Properties (from `checksec`):
1. **RELRO: Full**  
   - Full RELRO (Relocation Read-Only) is enabled, which makes certain sections of the binary (like the Global Offset Table, GOT) read-only after initialization. This mitigates certain types of GOT overwrite attacks.

2. **Canary: Yes**  
   - Stack canaries are enabled, which protect against stack-based buffer overflows. If a buffer overflow overwrites the return address on the stack, the canary value will also be overwritten, and the program will detect this and terminate.

3. **NX: Yes**  
   - Non-Executable (NX) is enabled, meaning that memory regions like the stack and heap cannot be executed. This prevents attackers from injecting and executing shellcode in these regions.

4. **PIE: No**  
   - Position-Independent Executable (PIE) is **not** enabled. This means the binary is loaded at a fixed address in memory, making it easier for an attacker to predict the location of code and data in memory. This is a potential weakness.

5. **RPATH/Runpath: No**  
   - No RPATH or RUNPATH is set, which is good because these could potentially be abused to load malicious libraries.

6. **Symbols: Yes**  
   - The binary contains symbols, which makes reverse engineering easier. This is useful for analyzing the binary during a CTF.

7. **Fortify Source: Yes**  
   - The binary is compiled with `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2`, which adds additional checks for certain functions (e.g., `strcpy`, `sprintf`) to prevent buffer overflows.

8. **Fortified: 1/3**  
   - Out of 3 functions that could be fortified, only 1 is actually fortified. This indicates that not all potentially vulnerable functions are protected by `_FORTIFY_SOURCE`.

### Summary of Strengths and Weaknesses:
#### Strengths:
- Full RELRO, stack canaries, and NX are enabled, which provide strong protections against common exploitation techniques like GOT overwrites, stack-based buffer overflows, and code injection.
- The binary is not stripped, which makes it easier to analyze and debug during the CTF.

#### Weaknesses:
- PIE is not enabled, which makes the binary's memory layout predictable. This could be exploited in conjunction with other vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows or heap exploitation) to perform Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) or other attacks.
- Only 1 out of 3 fortifiable functions is fortified, leaving some functions potentially vulnerable to exploitation.

### Exploitation Considerations:
Given the security properties, here are some potential attack vectors to consider:
1. **Heap Exploitation**: Since the binary is named `heap2`, it likely involves heap-based vulnerabilities. Look for common heap exploitation techniques like use-after-free, double free, or heap buffer overflows.
2. **No PIE**: The lack of PIE makes it easier to predict the memory layout of the binary. If you can leak an address (e.g., through a format string vulnerability or an infoleak), you can calculate the addresses of other parts of the binary.
3. **Bypassing NX**: Since NX is enabled, you cannot execute shellcode directly. You may need to use techniques like ROP or ret2libc to execute code indirectly.
4. **RELRO**: Full RELRO makes GOT overwrites unlikely, so focus on other exploitation techniques.

### Next Steps:
- Analyze the binary for heap-related vulnerabilities (e.g., use-after-free, double free, or heap overflows).
- Look for ways to leak memory addresses to bypass ASLR (if enabled on the system).
- Use the symbol information to understand the program's logic and identify potential vulnerabilities.
- Test for input validation issues, such as buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, or improper handling of user input.

This binary seems to be a good candidate for heap exploitation, so focus your efforts on understanding how the heap is managed and look for vulnerabilities in heap operations.
