 '**Explanation:**\n'
 '\n'
 '1. **Set up the context and ELF object:**\n'
 '   - We specify the target binary using `context.binary` and create an ELF '
 'object for easy access to symbols.\n'
 '\n'
 '2. **Start the process:**\n'
 '   - We use `process` to run the binary locally.\n'
 '   - Optionally, we can attach GDB for debugging to step through the code '
 "and monitor the exploit's behavior.\n"
 '\n'
 '3. **Calculate the offset:**\n'
 '   - The buffer size is 128 bytes.\n'
 '   - On a 64-bit architecture, the saved base pointer (RBP) is 8 bytes.\n'
 '   - Therefore, the total offset to the return address is `128 (buffer) + 8 '
 '(saved RBP) = 136` bytes.\n'
 '\n'
 '4. **Retrieve the address of `callsystem`:**\n'
 "   - We use `elf.symbols['callsystem']` to get the address of the "
 '`callsystem` function from the symbol table.\n'
 '   - This address will overwrite the return address on the stack.\n'
 '\n'
 '5. **Construct the payload:**\n'
 '   - We use `flat` to create a contiguous payload:\n'
 "     - `b'A' * offset` creates padding to fill the buffer up to the return "
 'address.\n'
 '     - `callsystem_addr` is the new return address, pointing to the '
 '`callsystem` function.\n'
 '\n'
 '6. **Send the payload:**\n'
 '   - We send the payload to the binary using `sendline`, which includes a '
 'newline character at the end.\n'
 '\n'
 '7. **Interact with the shell:**\n'
 '   - We use `interactive()` to switch to an interactive session, allowing us '
 'to interact with the shell spawned by the exploit.\n'
 '\n'
 '**Notes:**\n'
 '\n'
 '- **Binary Name:**\n'
 "  - Ensure that the binary you're exploiting is named `vuln` or update the "
 'script to match the actual binary name.\n'
 '\n'
 '- **Non-Stripped Binary:**\n'
 '  - The binary should not be stripped so that symbol names like `callsystem` '
 "are available. If the binary is stripped, you'll need to find the address of "
 '`callsystem` using a disassembler or debugger.\n'
 '\n'
 '- **Remote Exploitation:**\n'
 '  - If the binary is running on a remote server, replace `process(elf.path)` '
 "with `remote('hostname', port)` and ensure you have network access to the "
 'target.\n'
 '\n'
 '- **Adjustments:**\n'
 '  - If the architecture or calling conventions differ (e.g., 32-bit system), '
 'adjust the offset calculation accordingly.\n'
 '  - Verify the offset by using cyclic patterns from pwntools if necessary:\n'
 '    ```python\n'
 '    payload = cyclic(200)\n'
 '    p.sendline(payload)\n'
 '    p.wait()\n'
 '    core = p.corefile\n'
 '    offset = cyclic_find(core.read(core.rsp, 4))\n'
 '    log.info(f"Offset found at {offset} bytes")\n'
 '    ```\n'
 '    - This helps confirm the exact offset to the return address.\n'
 '\n'
 '- **Security Measures:**\n'
 '  - If the binary has security measures like Address Space Layout '
 'Randomization (ASLR), Stack Canaries, or Non-Executable Stack, additional '
 'steps may be required to bypass them.\n'
 '\n'
 '- **Testing:**\n'
 '  - Test your exploit locally before attempting it on any remote service.\n'
 "  - Use debugging tools to step through the exploit and ensure it's working "
 'as intended.\n'
 '\n'
 'By following these steps and using pwntools, you can construct an exploit '
 'that leverages the buffer overflow to execute arbitrary code, in this case, '
 'spawning a shell through the `callsystem()` function.')
