Based on the provided information, here is the analysis of the binary:

### 1. **File Information**
The binary is a 64-bit ELF executable:
- **64-bit LSB**: The binary is compiled for a 64-bit architecture, specifically x86-64.
- **PIE (Position Independent Executable)**: The binary is compiled as a PIE, meaning the base address of the binary will be randomized every time it is executed. This makes Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) attacks more challenging, as the addresses of functions and gadgets will change with each execution.
- **Dynamically linked**: The binary uses shared libraries, which means it relies on external libraries for some of its functionality.
- **Not stripped**: The binary still contains symbol information, which can be useful for reverse engineering and debugging.

### 2. **Security Properties (Checksec Output)**
- **RELRO: Full**: Full RELRO (Relocation Read-Only) is enabled, which protects the Global Offset Table (GOT) from being overwritten. This mitigates certain types of GOT overwrite attacks.
- **Canary: Yes**: Stack canaries are enabled, which protect against stack-based buffer overflows. If a buffer overflow overwrites the canary, the program will detect it and terminate.
- **NX: Yes**: Non-Executable (NX) bit is enabled, meaning the stack and other writable sections of memory cannot be executed. This prevents direct execution of shellcode injected into the stack or heap.
- **PIE: Yes**: As mentioned earlier, the binary is position-independent, and its base address will be randomized at runtime. This makes it harder to predict the location of functions and gadgets.
- **RPATH: No / RUNPATH: Yes**: The binary has a `RUNPATH` set, which specifies directories to search for shared libraries at runtime. This is not directly exploitable but could be relevant in certain scenarios involving library hijacking.
- **Symbols: Yes**: The binary contains symbol information, which can make reverse engineering easier.
- **Fortify Source: No**: The binary is not compiled with `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE`, which is a compiler feature that adds additional checks for certain functions (e.g., `strcpy`, `sprintf`) to prevent buffer overflows.
- **Fortified: 0 / Fortify-able: 2**: None of the functions that could be fortified have been fortified. This means there may be some unsafe function calls in the binary.

### 3. **Implications for Exploitation**
Given the security features enabled, here are the challenges and potential attack vectors:
- **Stack Canary**: Exploiting a stack-based buffer overflow will require bypassing the stack canary. This typically involves leaking the canary value first.
- **NX Enabled**: Directly executing shellcode on the stack or heap is not possible. You will need to use a ROP chain or other techniques to execute code.
- **PIE Enabled**: Since the binary is PIE, the base address of the binary will be randomized. You will need to leak an address (e.g., from the GOT or stack) to calculate the base address and find the locations of functions or gadgets.
- **Full RELRO**: Overwriting GOT entries is not possible, so you cannot use techniques like GOT hijacking.
- **Not Stripped**: The presence of symbols makes reverse engineering easier, as you can identify functions and variables more easily.

### 4. **Recommended Approach**
To exploit this binary, you will likely need to:
1. **Leak Information**: Use a vulnerability (e.g., format string or buffer overflow) to leak memory addresses. This could include leaking the stack canary, PIE base address, or libc base address.
2. **Bypass Stack Canary**: If the vulnerability involves a stack-based buffer overflow, you will need to leak the stack canary and include it in your payload to avoid detection.
3. **Build a ROP Chain**: Since NX is enabled, you will need to construct a ROP chain to execute your desired code. This could involve calling `system("/bin/sh")` or using a one-gadget from libc.
4. **Handle PIE**: Use the leaked PIE base address to calculate the addresses of functions and gadgets in the binary.

### 5. **Tools to Use**
- **Ghidra / IDA Pro**: For reverse engineering the binary and understanding its functionality.
- **pwntools**: For scripting the exploit and automating tasks like leaking addresses and constructing payloads.
- **gdb / pwndbg**: For debugging the binary and analyzing its behavior during exploitation.
- **ROPgadget / Ropper**: For finding ROP gadgets in the binary or libc.

### Conclusion
This binary has several security features enabled (PIE, NX, Canary, Full RELRO), which make exploitation more challenging. However, with the right approach (e.g., information leakage, ROP chain construction), it is still possible to exploit the binary. The presence of symbols and the lack of fortification may provide additional opportunities for exploitation.
