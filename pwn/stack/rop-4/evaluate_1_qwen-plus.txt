Certainly! Let's analyze the provided information about the binary `rop4` and its security properties.

### File Information

The output of the `file` command indicates the following:

- **ELF 32-bit LSB executable**: The binary is a 32-bit executable in the ELF (Executable and Linkable Format).
- **Intel 80386**: It is compiled for the x86 architecture.
- **version 1 (GNU/Linux)**: It is compatible with GNU/Linux systems.
- **statically linked**: The binary is statically linked, meaning all the required libraries are included within the binary itself.
- **for GNU/Linux 2.6.24**: It is built for a specific version of the Linux kernel.
- **BuildID[sha1]=58db790a742bb1b283bc3301fa309bf5f4e23b27**: This is a unique identifier for the build.
- **not stripped**: The binary still contains debug symbols, which can be useful for reverse engineering.

### Security Properties

The output of the `checksec` command provides the following security properties:

- **relro: partial**: Partial RELRO (Relocation Read-Only) is enabled, which means some relocations are protected, but not all. This can make it harder to overwrite certain pointers.
- **canary: no**: Stack canaries are not enabled, which means there is no protection against stack buffer overflows.
- **nx: yes**: NX (Non-Executable) bit is enabled, which marks the stack as non-executable. This prevents direct execution of code on the stack.
- **pie: no**: Position Independent Executable (PIE) is not enabled, so the base address of the binary is fixed. This makes ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) less effective.
- **rpath: no**: No RPATH (Run-time search path) is set, which means the dynamic linker will not use a hardcoded path to find shared libraries.
- **runpath: no**: No RUNPATH is set, similar to RPATH.
- **symbols: yes**: Debug symbols are present, which can aid in reverse engineering.
- **fortify_source: no**: Fortify Source is not enabled, which means the compiler does not add additional checks to detect buffer overflows.
- **fortified: 0**: No functions have been fortified.
- **fortify-able: 0**: No functions could be fortified.

### Analysis

Given the security properties, here are some key points to consider for exploiting this binary:

1. **Stack Canaries (No)**: Since stack canaries are not enabled, you can exploit stack-based buffer overflows without worrying about canary values. This makes it easier to achieve control over the instruction pointer (EIP).

2. **NX (Yes)**: The NX bit is enabled, which means you cannot directly execute code on the stack. However, since the binary is statically linked, you can use Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) to execute existing code snippets (gadgets) within the binary.

3. **Partial RELRO (Partial)**: Partial RELRO provides some protection against overwriting certain pointers, but it is not as strong as full RELRO. You may still be able to overwrite certain GOT (Global Offset Table) entries or other pointers.

4. **No PIE (No)**: The lack of PIE means the base address of the binary is fixed, making it easier to predict addresses of functions and gadgets. This is particularly useful for ROP chains.

5. **Debug Symbols (Yes)**: The presence of debug symbols can greatly aid in understanding the structure and flow of the binary, making it easier to identify vulnerable functions and potential gadgets.

### Next Steps

To proceed with the exploitation, you might want to:

1. **Identify Vulnerable Functions**: Use tools like `gdb` or `radare2` to find functions that have buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
2. **Find Gadgets**: Use tools like `ropper` or `ROPgadget` to find useful gadgets within the binary.
3. **Construct ROP Chain**: Create a ROP chain to bypass the NX protection and achieve your desired effect (e.g., calling `system("/bin/sh")` to get a shell).
4. **Test and Refine**: Test your exploit in a controlled environment to ensure it works as expected.

By leveraging the lack of stack canaries and the presence of debug symbols, combined with the fixed base address due to no PIE, you should be able to construct a successful ROP chain to exploit the binary.
