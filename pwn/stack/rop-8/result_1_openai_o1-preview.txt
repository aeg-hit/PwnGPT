 '**Notes:**\n'
 '\n'
 "- **Binary Path**: Replace `'./chall'` with the actual path to the binary "
 'provided in the challenge.\n'
 '- **Remote Connection**: If the challenge is hosted remotely, use the '
 '`remote` function instead of `process`, and provide the appropriate `host` '
 'and `port`.\n'
 "- **Context Settings**: Ensure that the architecture (`'amd64'` for 64-bit "
 "or `'i386'` for 32-bit) matches the target binary.\n"
 "- **Shellcode**: We're using pwntools' `shellcraft` to generate shellcode "
 "that spawns a shell. Adjust the shellcode if needed based on the challenge's "

 '- **Payload Size**: The `assert` statement ensures that the payload does not '
 'exceed the buffer size (0x400 bytes in this case).\n'
 '\n'
 '**Explanation of the Exploit:**\n'
 '\n'
 "- The program reads up to 0x400 bytes (1024 bytes) into a buffer that's only "
 '16 bytes long, leading to a buffer overflow vulnerability.\n'
 '- It prints the address of the buffer, which we use to know where our '
 'shellcode will be placed in memory.\n'
 '- We place our shellcode at the beginning of the payload.\n'
 '- We pad the payload with NOPs (`\\x90`) up to the offset where we overwrite '
 'the return address.\n'
 "- We overwrite the return address with the buffer's address, so when the "
 'function returns, execution jumps to our shellcode.\n'
 "- Finally, we interact with the shell that we've spawned.\n"

 '**Running the Script:**\n'
