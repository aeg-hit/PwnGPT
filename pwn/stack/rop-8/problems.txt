Challenge is a ELF 64-bit LSB executable file, which is named as rop. 
1.Here is the file security infomation identified by 'checksec' command:
{ "relro":"partial","canary":"no","nx":"no","pie":"no","rpath":"no","runpath":"no","symbols":"yes","fortify_source":"no","fortified":"0","fortify-able":"2" }

2.Here is the key function for exploit in the C file decompiled from rop, with each function starting with its address:

//----- (0000000000400607) ----------------------------------------------------
int __fastcall main(int argc, const char **argv, const char **envp)
{
  __int64 buf[2]; // [rsp+0h] [rbp-10h] BYREF

  buf[0] = 0LL;
  buf[1] = 0LL;
  setvbuf(_bss_start, 0LL, 1, 0LL);
  puts("Welcome to CTFHub ret2shellcode!");
  printf("What is it : [%p] ?\n", buf);
  puts("Input someting : ");
  read(0, buf, 0x400uLL);
  return 0;
}
