We send this pattern to the program and wait for it to crash. After the crash, we extract the value of the instruction pointer (`EIP`) from the core dump. `cyclic_find(eip_value)` helps us find the exact offset where the overwrite happens.\n\n- **Step 2:** Using pwntools\' ELF parsing capabilities, we extract the address of the `not_called` function.\n\n- **Step 3:** We construct the payload by padding with `A`s up to the offset and then appending the address of `not_called`. The `p32` function ensures that the address is packed correctly for a 32-bit little-endian system.\n\n- **Step 4:** We send the payload to the program and then switch to interactive mode with `p.interactive()`, allowing us to interact with the shell spawned by `system("/bin/bash")`.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- Make sure you have the binary executable (`binary_name`) in the same directory as your script or provide the correct path.\n- Ensure that the binary has execute permissions: `chmod +x binary_name`.\n- If the binary is running on a remote server or has additional protections (like stack canaries, NX bit, ASLR), you might need to adjust the exploit accordingly.\n- If DEP/NX is enabled and the stack is non-executable, this return-to-function technique (return-to-libc) is a standard way to get code execution without injecting code.\n\n**Example Output:**\n\nWhen you run the script, it should output something like:\n\n```\nOffset to return address: 140\nAddress of \'not_called\': 0x80484a4\n[*] Switching to interactive mode\n$ \n```\n\nAt this point, you\'re interacting with the shell spawned by the exploited binary.\n\n**Disclaimer:**\n\nEnsure you have permission to test and exploit this binary.
