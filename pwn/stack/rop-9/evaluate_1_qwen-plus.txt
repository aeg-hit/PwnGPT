Certainly! Let's analyze the provided information about the binary `rop9`:

### File Information
```
./pwn/stack/rop-9/rop9: ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (GNU/Linux), statically linked, for GNU/Linux 2.6.32, not stripped
```
- **ELF 32-bit LSB executable**: The binary is a 32-bit Linux executable.
- **Intel 80386**: It is compiled for the x86 architecture.
- **Statically linked**: All required libraries are included within the binary itself. This means you won't have to worry about external dependencies but the binary will be larger.
- **Not stripped**: The binary includes debug symbols and other metadata, which can be useful for reverse engineering and exploitation.

### Security Properties
```json
{
    "./pwn/stack/rop-9/rop9": {
        "relro": "partial",
        "canary": "no",
        "nx": "yes",
        "pie": "no",
        "rpath": "no",
        "runpath": "no",
        "symbols": "yes",
        "fortify_source": "no",
        "fortified": "0",
        "fortify-able": "0"
    }
}
```
- **relro: partial**: Partial RELRO (Relocation Read-Only) is enabled, which provides some protection against overwriting GOT (Global Offset Table) entries. However, it is not as strong as full RELRO.
- **canary: no**: Stack canaries are not enabled, which means there is no additional protection against stack buffer overflows.
- **nx: yes**: NX (Non-Executable) bit is enabled, which marks the stack as non-executable. This prevents direct code execution from the stack.
- **pie: no**: Position Independent Executable (PIE) is not enabled, meaning the base address of the binary is fixed. This makes ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) less effective.
- **rpath: no** and **runpath: no**: These are not set, which is typical for statically linked binaries.
- **symbols: yes**: Debug symbols are present, which can aid in reverse engineering and exploitation.
- **fortify_source: no**: The `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE` compiler flag is not used, so there are no additional checks for common vulnerabilities like buffer overflows.
- **fortified: 0** and **fortify-able: 0**: No functions have been fortified, and no functions could be fortified.

### Analysis
Given the security properties and file information, here are some key points to consider for exploiting this binary:

1. **Stack Buffer Overflow**: Since stack canaries are not enabled, the binary is vulnerable to stack buffer overflow attacks. You can overflow a buffer to overwrite the return address and control the flow of execution.

2. **Return-Oriented Programming (ROP)**: Given that NX is enabled, you cannot directly execute shellcode on the stack. However, since the binary is statically linked, you can use ROP gadgets within the binary itself to bypass NX. The presence of debug symbols can help you find useful gadgets.

3. **Fixed Address Space**: The lack of PIE means the base address of the binary is fixed, making it easier to predict addresses for ROP chains.

4. **Debug Symbols**: The presence of debug symbols can significantly aid in understanding the binary's structure and finding vulnerable functions or gadgets.

### Steps to Exploit
1. **Identify Vulnerable Functions**: Use tools like `gdb` or `radare2` to identify functions that may be vulnerable to buffer overflows.
2. **Find ROP Gadgets**: Use tools like `ropper` or `ROPgadget` to find useful gadgets within the binary.
3. **Construct ROP Chain**: Create a ROP chain to bypass NX and achieve arbitrary code execution.
4. **Exploit the Vulnerability**: Craft an exploit payload that triggers the buffer overflow and executes the ROP chain.

By leveraging these properties, you should be able to develop a successful exploit for the `rop9` binary.
